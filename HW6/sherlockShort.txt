I.

To Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him
mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and
predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion
akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,
were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He
was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that
the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a
false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe
and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observerâ€”excellent for
drawing the veil from menâ€™s motives and actions. But for the trained
reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might
throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive
instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not
be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And
yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene
Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away
from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred
interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master
of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,
while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian
soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old
books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,
the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen
nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,
and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of
observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those
mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.
From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his
summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up
of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and
finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and
successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of
his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of
the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.

One nightâ€”it was on the twentieth of March, 1888â€”I was returning from a
journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when
my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered
door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and
with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a
keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his
extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I
looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette
against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his
head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who
knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own
story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created
dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell
and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.

His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,
to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved
me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a
spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire
and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.

â€œWedlock suits you,â€ he remarked. â€œI think, Watson, that you have put
on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.â€

â€œSeven!â€ I answered.

â€œIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I
fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me
that you intended to go into harness.â€

â€œThen, how do you know?â€

â€œI see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting
yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless
servant girl?â€

â€œMy dear Holmes,â€ said I, â€œthis is too much. You would certainly have
been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a
country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I
have changed my clothes I canâ€™t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary
Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,
again, I fail to see how you work it out.â€

He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.

â€œIt is simplicity itself,â€ said he; â€œmy eyes tell me that on the inside
of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is
scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by
someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in
order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double
deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a
particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As
to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of
iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right
forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where
he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not
pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.â€

I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his
process of deduction. â€œWhen I hear you give your reasons,â€ I remarked,
â€œthe thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I
could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your
reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I
believe that my eyes are as good as yours.â€

â€œQuite so,â€ he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself
down into an armchair. â€œYou see, but you do not observe. The
distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps
which lead up from the hall to this room.â€

â€œFrequently.â€

â€œHow often?â€

â€œWell, some hundreds of times.â€

â€œThen how many are there?â€

â€œHow many? I donâ€™t know.â€

â€œQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just
my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have
both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these
little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two
of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.â€ He threw
over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open
upon the table. â€œIt came by the last post,â€ said he. â€œRead it aloud.â€

The note was undated, and without either signature or address.

â€œThere will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight oâ€™clock,â€ it
said, â€œa gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very
deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of
Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with
matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.
This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your
chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor
wear a mask.â€

â€œThis is indeed a mystery,â€ I remarked. â€œWhat do you imagine that it
means?â€

â€œI have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has
data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of
theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from
it?â€

I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was
written.

â€œThe man who wrote it was presumably well to do,â€ I remarked,
endeavouring to imitate my companionâ€™s processes. â€œSuch paper could not
be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and
stiff.â€

â€œPeculiarâ€”that is the very word,â€ said Holmes. â€œIt is not an English
paper at all. Hold it up to the light.â€

I did so, and saw a large â€œEâ€ with a small â€œg,â€ a â€œP,â€ and a large â€œGâ€
with a small â€œtâ€ woven into the texture of the paper.

â€œWhat do you make of that?â€ asked Holmes.

â€œThe name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.â€

â€œNot at all. The â€˜Gâ€™ with the small â€˜tâ€™ stands for â€˜Gesellschaft,â€™
which is the German for â€˜Company.â€™ It is a customary contraction like
our â€˜Co.â€™ â€˜P,â€™ of course, stands for â€˜Papier.â€™ Now for the â€˜Eg.â€™ Let us
glance at our Continental Gazetteer.â€ He took down a heavy brown volume
from his shelves. â€œEglow, Eglonitzâ€”here we are, Egria. It is in a
German-speaking countryâ€”in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. â€˜Remarkable
as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous
glass-factories and paper-mills.â€™ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of
that?â€ His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud
from his cigarette.

â€œThe paper was made in Bohemia,â€ I said.

â€œPrecisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the
peculiar construction of the sentenceâ€”â€˜This account of you we have from
all quarters received.â€™ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written
that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only
remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who
writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his
face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our
doubts.â€

As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horsesâ€™ hoofs and grating
wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes
whistled.

â€œA pair, by the sound,â€ said he. â€œYes,â€ he continued, glancing out of
the window. â€œA nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred
and fifty guineas apiece. Thereâ€™s money in this case, Watson, if there
is nothing else.â€

â€œI think that I had better go, Holmes.â€

â€œNot a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.
And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.â€

â€œBut your clientâ€”â€

â€œNever mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.
Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.â€

A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the
passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and
authoritative tap.

â€œCome in!â€ said Holmes.

A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches
in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich
with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad
taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and
fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was
thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and
secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming
beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were
trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of
barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He
carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper
part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard
mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand
was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face
he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,
and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length
of obstinacy.

â€œYou had my note?â€ he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly
marked German accent. â€œI told you that I would call.â€ He looked from
one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.

â€œPray take a seat,â€ said Holmes. â€œThis is my friend and colleague, Dr.
Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom
have I the honour to address?â€

â€œYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I
understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and
discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme
importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you
alone.â€

I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into
my chair. â€œIt is both, or none,â€ said he. â€œYou may say before this
gentleman anything which you may say to me.â€

The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. â€œThen I must begin,â€ said he,
â€œby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of
that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too
much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon
European history.â€

â€œI promise,â€ said Holmes.

â€œAnd I.â€

â€œYou will excuse this mask,â€ continued our strange visitor. â€œThe august
person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may
confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is
not exactly my own.â€

â€œI was aware of it,â€ said Holmes dryly.

â€œThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to
be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and
seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak
plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary
kings of Bohemia.â€

â€œI was also aware of that,â€ murmured Holmes, settling himself down in
his armchair and closing his eyes.

Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,
lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the
most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes
slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.

â€œIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,â€ he remarked, â€œI
should be better able to advise you.â€

The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in
uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore
the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. â€œYou are right,â€
he cried; â€œI am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?â€

â€œWhy, indeed?â€ murmured Holmes. â€œYour Majesty had not spoken before I
was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von
Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of
Bohemia.â€

â€œBut you can understand,â€ said our strange visitor, sitting down once
more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, â€œyou can
understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own
person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to
an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come _incognito_
from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.â€

â€œThen, pray consult,â€ said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.

â€œThe facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy
visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,
Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.â€

â€œKindly look her up in my index, Doctor,â€ murmured Holmes without
opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing
all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to
name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish
information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between
that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a
monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.

â€œLet me see!â€ said Holmes. â€œHum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.
Contraltoâ€”hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsawâ€”yes!
Retired from operatic stageâ€”ha! Living in Londonâ€”quite so! Your
Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person,
wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting
those letters back.â€

â€œPrecisely so. But howâ€”â€

â€œWas there a secret marriage?â€

â€œNone.â€

â€œNo legal papers or certificates?â€

â€œNone.â€

â€œThen I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should
produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to
prove their authenticity?â€

â€œThere is the writing.â€

â€œPooh, pooh! Forgery.â€

â€œMy private note-paper.â€

â€œStolen.â€

â€œMy own seal.â€

â€œImitated.â€

â€œMy photograph.â€

â€œBought.â€

â€œWe were both in the photograph.â€

â€œOh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an
indiscretion.â€

â€œI was madâ€”insane.â€

â€œYou have compromised yourself seriously.â€

â€œI was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.â€

â€œIt must be recovered.â€

â€œWe have tried and failed.â€

â€œYour Majesty must pay. It must be bought.â€

â€œShe will not sell.â€

â€œStolen, then.â€

â€œFive attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her
house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has
been waylaid. There has been no result.â€

â€œNo sign of it?â€

â€œAbsolutely none.â€

Holmes laughed. â€œIt is quite a pretty little problem,â€ said he.

â€œBut a very serious one to me,â€ returned the King reproachfully.

â€œVery, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?â€

â€œTo ruin me.â€

â€œBut how?â€

â€œI am about to be married.â€

â€œSo I have heard.â€

â€œTo Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of
Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is
herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct
would bring the matter to an end.â€

â€œAnd Irene Adler?â€

â€œThreatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that
she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She
has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most
resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no
lengths to which she would not goâ€”none.â€

â€œYou are sure that she has not sent it yet?â€

â€œI am sure.â€

â€œAnd why?â€

â€œBecause she has said that she would send it on the day when the
betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.â€

â€œOh, then we have three days yet,â€ said Holmes with a yawn. â€œThat is
very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into
just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the
present?â€

â€œCertainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count
Von Kramm.â€

â€œThen I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.â€

â€œPray do so. I shall be all anxiety.â€

â€œThen, as to money?â€

â€œYou have _carte blanche_.â€

â€œAbsolutely?â€

â€œI tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to
have that photograph.â€

â€œAnd for present expenses?â€

The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid
it on the table.

â€œThere are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,â€ he
said.

Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it
to him.

â€œAnd Mademoiselleâ€™s address?â€ he asked.

â€œIs Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. Johnâ€™s Wood.â€

Holmes took a note of it. â€œOne other question,â€ said he. â€œWas the
photograph a cabinet?â€
