Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss: 1

I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and: 1
I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore: 1
I did so, and saw a large â€œEâ€ with a small â€œg,â€ a â€œP,â€ and a large â€œGâ€: 1

I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.â€: 1
I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile: 1
I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.: 1
I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six: 1
I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning: 1
I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and: 1
I had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a: 1

I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional: 1
I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away: 1
I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would: 1

I held the little printed slip to the light. â€œMissing,â€ it said, â€œon: 1

I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this: 1
I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such: 1

I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into: 1

bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as: 1
bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your: 1

beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old: 1
besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in: 1

between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the: 1

between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which: 1
between the years â€™82 and â€™90, I am faced by so many which present: 1
between you and your father?: 1
bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a: 1
billet.â€™: 1
bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at: 1
bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but: 1
bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of: 1
black cloud which rests upon their past.: 1
black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. â€˜You have: 1
block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp: 1
blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,: 1
bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save: 1
blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready: 1
blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmesâ€™ attention to: 1
blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might: 1
blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore: 1
blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our: 1
bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man,: 1
body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible.: 1
body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her: 1
body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the: 1
boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.: 1
bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind: 1
bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow: 1
bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here: 1
book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the: 1
books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,: 1
boots, his socks, his hat, and his watchâ€”all were there. There were no: 1
boots. â€œI think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of: 1
bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my: 1
borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It: 1

both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the: 1
bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock: 1
box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram: 1
box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed,: 1
boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always: 1
brain-fever, and for six weeks was at deathâ€™s door. Then she got better: 1
branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and: 1
brandy and water within his reach.: 1
brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to: 1
breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we: 1
bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon: 1

breakfast.â€: 1
breakfasts at home.â€: 1
breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from: 1
breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of: 1
breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew,: 1
breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.: 1
breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had: 1
breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside: 1
breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on: 1
breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of: 1
bred.â€: 1

bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater,: 1
brideâ€™s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. â€œThere,â€: 1
bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the: 1
bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and: 1
bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still: 1
bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but: 1
brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city.: 1
brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think: 1
bring him out and associate him with this investigation.â€: 1
broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic: 1
broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could: 1

brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little: 1
brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you: 1

half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the _dÃ©nouement_ of: 1

half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away: 1

having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet: 1
having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in: 1
having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I: 1
having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.: 1
having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me!: 1
he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are: 1
he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,: 1
he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.: 1
he asked. â€œHow did you know, for example, that I did manual labour.: 1
he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and: 1
he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick: 1
he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could: 1
he cried; â€œI am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?â€: 1
he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of: 1
he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to: 1
he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely: 1
he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son;: 1
he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly: 1
he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every: 1
he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and: 1
he had set himself to hunt down.: 1
he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not: 1
he has Â£ 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank.: 1
he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity: 1
he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn: 1
he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon: 1
he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment: 1
he might direct.: 1
he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of: 1
he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very: 1
he say when he returns?â€: 1
he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice,: 1
he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the: 1
he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to: 1
he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked: 1
he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated: 1
he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss: 1
he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.: 1
he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply: 1
he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped: 1
he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow,: 1
he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried: 1
he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.: 1
he, â€œmy real name is James Ryder.â€: 1
he.: 1
he. â€œI daresay that if I had put Â£ 100 down in front of him, that man: 1
head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who: 1
head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings,: 1
head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.: 1
head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward: 1

heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I: 1
heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of: 1
heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like: 1
heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.: 1
heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the: 1
heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It: 1
heard of since. Was dressed in,â€™ etc., etc. Ha! That represents the: 1
heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me: 1
heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcarâ€™s?â€: 1
heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he: 1
heart.: 1
heartily for some minutes.: 1
heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again: 1
heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmesâ€™: 1
height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off,: 1
heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin: 1
held it out upon the palm of his hand.: 1
help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an: 1
help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense: 1
her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we: 1
her arms round him and tried to hold him back.: 1
her at such a crisis.â€: 1
her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several: 1
her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms: 1
her fatherâ€™s house?â€: 1
her finger into the air in the direction of the Doctorâ€™s room, but a: 1
her forearm. â€œWe shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You: 1
her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as: 1
her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear,: 1
her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an: 1
her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered: 1
her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we: 1
her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It: 1
her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly: 1
her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I: 1
her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.: 1
her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She: 1
her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she: 1
her position must have been uncomfortable with her fatherâ€™s young wife.: 1
her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.â€: 1

her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could: 1

her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to: 1

herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was: 1

hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must: 1
hereâ€â€”I picked up the morning paper from the groundâ€”â€œlet us put it to a: 1
herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what: 1
herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct: 1
hersâ€”possibly her _fiancÃ©_â€”and no doubt, as you wore the girlâ€™s dress: 1
high spirits. â€œIt is a little off the beaten track, isnâ€™t it?â€ said he.: 1
highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural: 1
highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared,: 1
him a price for the stones he heldâ€”Â£ 1000 apiece. That brought out the: 1
him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.: 1
him back to her?: 1
him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.: 1
him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking: 1
him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife: 1
him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two oâ€™clock,: 1
him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to: 1
him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice: 1
him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me.: 1
him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one: 1
him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was: 1
him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.: 1
him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax: 1
him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very: 1
him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her: 1
him.: 1
him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life: 1
him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I: 1
him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled: 1
him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in: 1
him.â€: 1
him?â€: 1
himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment: 1
himself down into his chair once more. â€œThat fellow will rise from: 1
himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the: 1
himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is: 1
himself up onto the roof. â€œAh, yes,â€ he cried, â€œhereâ€™s the end of a: 1
himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding: 1
himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.: 1
himself.: 1
his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of: 1
his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.: 1
his armchair and closing his eyes.: 1
his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and: 1
his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected,: 1
his cane at the bell-pull.: 1
his chair, with his finger-tips together. â€œThe ideal reasoner,â€ he: 1
his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and: 1
his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.: 1
his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then: 1
his conviction of young McCarthyâ€™s innocence.: 1
his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with: 1
his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.: 1
his deathâ€”!â€ He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in: 1
his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully: 1
his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of _The Times_ and smoking: 1
his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his: 1
his expedition.: 1
his eyes into his head again.: 1
his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think,: 1
his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained: 1
his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen: 1
his father should, according to his account, cry â€˜Cooee!â€™ before seeing: 1
his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown: 1
his fingers upon the table.: 1
his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never: 1
his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. â€œI: 1
his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably: 1
his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might: 1
his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which: 1
his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that: 1
his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of: 1
his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials: 1
his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.: 1
his hands.: 1
his hands.â€: 1
his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.: 1
his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to: 1
his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very: 1
his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didnâ€™t want: 1
his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction!: 1
his lips to my ear.: 1
his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a: 1
his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he: 1
his money.â€: 1
his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards: 1
his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings: 1
his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my: 1
his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of: 1
his relatives should allow him to come out alone.â€: 1
his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but: 1
his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and: 1
his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large: 1
his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny: 1
his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to: 1
his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end: 1
his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and: 1
his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.: 1
holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be: 1
holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug,: 1
hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like: 1
home instantly and act.â€: 1
home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command: 1
homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the: 1
homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after: 1
homesteads?â€: 1
honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.: 1
honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!â€: 1
hope of finding them.â€: 1
hope that I may be back in a few hours.â€ He cut a slice of beef from: 1
hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.â€: 1
hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a: 1
hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak: 1
horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she: 1
horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my: 1
horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with: 1
horse on into a gallop. â€œI confess that I have been as blind as a mole,: 1
horse.: 1
horseâ€™s head while the other led us in.: 1
hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for: 1
hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got: 1
hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and: 1
hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became: 1
hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have: 1
hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the: 1
hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence: 1
hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small: 1
hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up: 1
hours, three pipes, four pipesâ€”I forget how many. But Iâ€™ll go home with: 1
hours?â€: 1
house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was: 1
house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story: 1
house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his: 1
house with me.â€: 1
house, â€œthis marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes: 1

hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be: 1
hurried from the room.: 1
hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom: 1
hurry.â€: 1
hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle: 1
hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that: 1
hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.â€: 1
husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give: 1

husbandâ€”the chances being in favour of the latter.â€: 1
husbandâ€™s cruelty to his wife.â€™ There is half a column of print, but I: 1
hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.â€: 1
idea came to me. I begged a fortnightâ€™s grace from the creditor, asked: 1
idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no: 1
if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,: 1
if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most: 1

illâ€”gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maidsâ€”joined in a general shriek of: 1
imagination.â€: 1
imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own: 1
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear: 1
impatience.: 1
impatiently, â€œwhen I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet: 1
implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the: 1
importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you: 1
important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and: 1
impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by: 1
impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which: 1
impressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that: 1
impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you: 1
impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the: 1
impressions. I passed along the tradesmenâ€™s path, but found it all: 1
imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable: 1
imprisonment?â€: 1
improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestradeâ€™s: 1
improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.â€: 1
improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit: 1
impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the: 1
in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest: 1
in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by: 1
in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or: 1
in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he: 1
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,: 1
in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance: 1
in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at: 1
in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat: 1
in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was: 1
in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more: 1
in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall: 1
in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my: 1
in any future proceedings which may arise.: 1
in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting: 1
in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I: 1
in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of: 1

in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the: 1

in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich: 1
in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human: 1
in her own house.â€: 1
in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and: 1
in his hands?â€: 1
in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked: 1
in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case: 1
in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a: 1
in it, of course?â€: 1
in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which: 1
in making a row.â€: 1
in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will: 1
in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly: 1
in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made: 1
in my ear. I didnâ€™t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make: 1
in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.: 1

in my shop. You see this little book?â€: 1
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO: 1

in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their: 1

in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.â€: 1
in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.: 1
in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to: 1

in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening: 1
in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London.: 1

in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us,: 1
in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it: 1
in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to: 1
incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If: 1
inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you: 1

inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like: 1
inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps,: 1

indeed. Let me see it.â€ He took up the paper in a listless way, but his: 1
india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk: 1
indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the: 1
indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a: 1
indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet: 1

informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused: 1
information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between: 1
inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby: 1
injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon: 1

innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was: 1

inquiries,â€ said Holmes carelessly. â€œIf you wonâ€™t tell us the bet is: 1
inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while: 1

insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a: 1
insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating: 1

instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made: 1
instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then: 1
instinct; perhaps it was womanâ€™s instinct which gave me that feeling.: 1

into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the: 1
into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few: 1
into character.: 1

into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what: 1
into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last,: 1
into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.: 1
into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had: 1
into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window: 1
into the most extraordinary contortions.: 1
into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope: 1
into the pew. There was a momentâ€™s delay, but the gentleman in the pew: 1
into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that: 1
into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into: 1
into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that: 1
into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the: 1

investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his: 1
investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as: 1
investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the: 1
investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the: 1

iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our: 1

it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof: 1
it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to: 1

it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to itâ€”that it is: 1

it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths: 1
it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.â€: 1
it,â€ returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his: 1
it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?â€: 1
it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have: 1
it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor: 1

its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give: 1

jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must: 1

jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as: 1
jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of: 1
jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it.: 1

temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.: 1

tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of: 1

that I have scored over you in your example.â€: 1
that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?â€ As he spoke,: 1
that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter: 1

that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his: 1
that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she,: 1
that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a: 1
that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.â€: 1
that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up: 1
that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that: 1
that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting: 1
that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have: 1
that all was secureâ€”a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I: 1
that as long as I live at home I donâ€™t wish to be a burden to them, and: 1
that came a long newspaper story about how a minersâ€™ camp had been: 1
that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young: 1
that didnâ€™t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as: 1
that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.: 1
that have ever come within my experience.â€: 1
that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing: 1
that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking: 1
that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help: 1
that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.â€: 1
that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did: 1
that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.â€: 1
that he has suffered.â€: 1
that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done: 1
that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him: 1
that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem: 1
that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and: 1
that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a: 1
that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right: 1
that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a: 1
that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to: 1
that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.: 1
that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained: 1
that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some: 1
that laugh.: 1
that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow: 1
that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever: 1
that my secret was safe in his possession.: 1
that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my: 1
that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a: 1
that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the: 1
that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and: 1
that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that: 1
that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what: 1
that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and: 1
that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.: 1
that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said: 1
that she was not on my level?â€: 1
that she would have been so carried away.â€: 1
that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an: 1
that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some: 1
that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Aliceâ€™s friend too.: 1
that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine: 1
that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two: 1
that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim: 1
that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by: 1
that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first: 1
that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which: 1
that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkardâ€™s blow,: 1
that the truth is known.â€: 1
that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a _bijou_: 1
that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only: 1
that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction: 1
that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now,: 1
that this smooth-faced pawnbrokerâ€™s assistant was a formidable manâ€”a: 1
that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too: 1
that we are in search of are to be found.â€: 1
that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw: 1
that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters: 1
that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must: 1
that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to: 1
that we have been as good as our word.â€: 1
that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to: 1
that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars: 1
that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.â€: 1
that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good: 1
that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was: 1
that were he. I thought I heard a ring.â€: 1
that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were: 1
that you have felt the draught.â€™: 1
that you intended to go into harness.â€: 1
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting: 1
that you wonâ€™t speak to me for fifty minutes.â€ He curled himself up in: 1
that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain: 1
that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only: 1
that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am: 1
that?â€ His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud: 1
the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and: 1
the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic: 1
the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers.: 1
the Continent.â€: 1
the Countess to say that we have it.â€: 1
the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very: 1

the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such: 1
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not: 1

the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you: 1
the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there: 1
the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began: 1
the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received: 1
the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head: 1
the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It: 1
the air.: 1
the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables: 1
the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss: 1
the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of: 1
the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up: 1
the bell.: 1
the blaze.: 1
the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again: 1
the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his: 1

the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice: 1
the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the: 1
the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be: 1
the brideâ€™s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as: 1
the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the: 1
the building.: 1
the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylottâ€™s, the second: 1
the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The: 1
the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway: 1
the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I: 1
the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you: 1
the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker: 1
the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it: 1

the colonel looking down at me.: 1
the commissionaire?â€: 1

the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some Â£ 30, to say: 1
the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a: 1
the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow: 1
the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his: 1
the coronet and of Arthurâ€™s face, she read the whole story and, with a: 1
the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending: 1
the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were: 1
the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had: 1
the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia,: 1
the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a: 1
the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.: 1
the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to: 1
the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe: 1
the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were: 1
the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark: 1
the direction of the old hatâ€”â€œbut there are points in connection with: 1
the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day: 1
the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at: 1
the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting: 1
the door.: 1
the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to: 1
the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and: 1
the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen: 1
the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to: 1
the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you: 1
the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young manâ€™s story: 1
the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear: 1
the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so: 1
the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I: 1
the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can: 1
the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these: 1
the fall in agricultural prices, not more than Â£ 750. Each daughter can: 1
the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager: 1
the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me: 1
the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any: 1
the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear: 1
the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in: 1
the fatherâ€™s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.: 1
the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in dangerâ€”â€: 1
the fireplace. â€œI only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I: 1
the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed: 1
the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered: 1
the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and: 1
the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself: 1
the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady,: 1
the flies, but not before.â€: 1
the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine: 1
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this: 1
the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before: 1
the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement: 1
the fringe of her jacket. â€œI met him first at the gasfittersâ€™ ball,â€: 1
the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself,: 1
the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main: 1
the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his: 1
the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in: 1
the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the: 1
the gas is not laid on in his house?â€: 1
the glint of a light.: 1
the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it: 1
the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and: 1
the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.â€™â€: 1
the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all: 1
the greatest concentration of attention.: 1
the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.: 1
the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,: 1
the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the: 1
the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by: 1
the hall, looking back into the street.: 1
the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctorâ€™s: 1
the history of the country. But if you have why, then, how could any: 1
the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the: 1
the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I: 1
the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants: 1
the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde: 1
the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,: 1
the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we: 1
the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no: 1
the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.â€: 1
the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes: 1
the inquest, and which are worth considering.â€: 1
the inquiry.â€: 1
the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K.: 1
the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of: 1
the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.â€: 1
the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there.: 1
the kitchen window?â€ Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get: 1
the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm.: 1
the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does: 1
the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the: 1
the lantern and gazed about him.: 1
the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where: 1
the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the: 1
the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with: 1
the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been: 1
the light and attacked it.â€: 1
the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even: 1
the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I: 1
the light was still there, ready to flash out at a momentâ€™s notice. To: 1
the line, â€œI should like just to remember the order of the houses here.: 1
the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some: 1
the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my: 1
the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half: 1
the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from: 1
the long run. I am going out now!â€: 1
the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in: 1
the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it.: 1
the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small: 1
the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell: 1
the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the: 1
the map. â€œWhat do you read?â€: 1
the market price.â€: 1
the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. â€œYou are right,â€: 1
the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once: 1
the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.â€: 1
the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?â€: 1
the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents,: 1
the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They: 1
the men of the family, and in my stepfatherâ€™s case it had, I believe,: 1
the moral retrogression?â€: 1
the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About: 1
the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had: 1
the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date: 1
the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been: 1
the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his: 1
the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull: 1
the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a: 1
the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at: 1
the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive: 1
the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose: 1
the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief: 1
the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was: 1
the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came: 1
the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that: 1
the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in: 1
the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to: 1
the other from the floor on which  we were and from the one beneath. My: 1
the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest: 1
the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the: 1
the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let: 1
the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at: 1
the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite: 1
the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite: 1
the photograph?â€: 1
the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.: 1
the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we: 1
the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now: 1
the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of: 1
the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.: 1
the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years: 1
the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh: 1
the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it: 1
the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which: 1
the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study: 1
the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned: 1
the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several: 1
the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland: 1
the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as: 1
the right forefinger. Her boots I didnâ€™t observe. She had small round,: 1
the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,: 1
the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on: 1
the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.: 1
the room to be a little close.â€™: 1
the room without another word.: 1
the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I: 1
the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur: 1
the rose-bushes.: 1
the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my: 1
the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by: 1
the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large: 1
the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded: 1
the same week. Ah, here it is: â€˜There will soon be a call for: 1
the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a: 1
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing: 1
the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,: 1
the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.: 1
the shutters.: 1
the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.â€: 1
the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and: 1
the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip: 1
the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at: 1
the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally,: 1
the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he: 1
the son.â€: 1
the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering: 1
the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in: 1
the south, then, and quick march!â€: 1
the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we: 1
the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever: 1
the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.: 1
the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken: 1
the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the: 1
the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the: 1
the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with: 1
the street, â€œhere is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that: 1
the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.â€: 1
the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I: 1
the sum I may draw.â€: 1
the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the: 1
the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately: 1
the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of: 1
the table in front of the colonelâ€™s plate. It was not a common thing: 1
the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand: 1
the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadnâ€™t: 1
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or: 1
the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from: 1
the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come: 1
the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.: 1
the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had: 1
the time of the war he fought in Jacksonâ€™s army, and afterwards under: 1
the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will: 1
the time when I saw Frank here again I just didnâ€™t know what I was: 1
the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the: 1
the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont: 1
the top of it.: 1
the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the: 1
the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit: 1
the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A: 1
the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.: 1
the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the: 1
the unconscious man out of the way of danger.: 1
the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and: 1
the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had: 1
the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,: 1
the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation: 1
the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took: 1
the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were: 1
the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we: 1
the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false: 1
the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away: 1
the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,: 1
the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.â€™: 1
the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.â€: 1
the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a: 1
the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary: 1
the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low: 1
the whole country as were brought together by that single: 1
the whole heâ€™s a good worker. Thereâ€™s no vice in him.â€: 1
the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your: 1
the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of: 1
the whole place is in a blaze.â€: 1
the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard: 1
the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,: 1
the window. â€œA nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred: 1
the windows?â€: 1
the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say: 1
the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a: 1
the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow: 1
the wrist and braced it up with a twig.â€: 1
the young ladyâ€™s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could: 1
the â€˜râ€™sâ€™ tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my: 1
their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to: 1
their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this: 1
their object was in playing this prankâ€”if it was a prankâ€”upon me. It: 1
their pick for Â£ 40? There must be some strong reason behind.â€: 1
their power.â€: 1
their reach.â€: 1
their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is: 1
their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side.: 1
them apart.â€™: 1
them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.: 1
them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote â€œS. H. for J.: 1
them right enough.â€: 1
them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be: 1
them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one: 1
them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my: 1
them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and: 1
them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client,: 1
them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself: 1
them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently: 1
them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all: 1
them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I: 1
them.â€: 2
then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but: 1
then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and: 1
then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight: 1
then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all: 1
then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of: 1
then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and: 1
then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.â€: 1
then turned upon my companion.: 1
then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all: 1
then, â€˜My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!â€™: 1
theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from: 1
theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.â€: 1
there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon: 1
there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find: 1
there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country,: 1
there before the altar.â€: 1
there for one night.â€: 1
there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as: 1
there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only: 1
there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out: 1
there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a: 1
there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along: 1
there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving: 1
there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter.: 1
there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to: 1
there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.: 1
there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little: 1
there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon: 1
there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us,: 1
there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring: 1
there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was: 1
there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things: 1
there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake: 1
there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance: 1
there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes: 1
there who stares up at Miss Hunter.â€™: 1
there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison: 1
there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what: 1
there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his: 1
therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that timeâ€”a deduction: 1
therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case: 1
therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a: 1
these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict: 1
these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen: 1
these gems?â€: 1
these perils are?â€: 1
these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and: 1
these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted: 1
they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him: 1
they come againâ€”of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they: 1
they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you: 1
they found in the pockets?â€: 1
they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should: 1
they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed: 1
they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant: 1
they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two: 1
they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen,: 1
they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. â€œHum!â€: 1
they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.: 1
thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually: 1
thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the: 1
thick with the ice crystals. â€œI suppose,â€ I remarked, â€œthat, homely as: 1
thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses: 1
thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. Iâ€™ll serve: 1
thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look: 1
thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and: 1
thing come from?â€™: 1
thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It: 1
thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a: 1
things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where: 1
things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and: 1
things in a different way.â€: 1
things that he would think of.â€: 1
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works: 1
think I shall just treat myself toâ€”â€ He took two swift steps to the: 1
think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table: 1
think that I could be of assistance to you.â€: 1
think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your: 1
think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if: 1
think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!â€: 1
think that we are wandering rather far from the point.â€: 1
think, were the main points of my analysis.â€: 1
thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in: 1
thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole: 1
thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then: 1
thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those: 1
thirty.: 1
this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on: 1
this clue while it is still hot.â€: 1
this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.â€: 1
this final quarrel?: 1
this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds,: 1
this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I: 1
this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read: 1
this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to: 1
this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there: 1
this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the: 1
this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside: 1
this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan: 1
this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for: 1
this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and: 1
this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me,: 1
this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your: 1
this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has: 1
this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some: 1
this offhand fashion.: 1
this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the: 1
this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which: 1
this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his: 1
this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I: 1
this that I do not think of Baxterâ€™s words, and say, â€˜There, but for: 1
this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to: 1
this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest,: 1
this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The: 1
this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected: 1
this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the: 1
this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly: 1
this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker: 1
thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed.: 1
thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of: 1
those details which seem to me to be most important.â€: 1
those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.: 1
those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain: 1
those letters back.â€: 1
those lines.â€: 1
those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree,: 1
those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they: 1
though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.â€: 1
though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all: 1
though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.â€: 1
though he little knew for what purpose.â€: 1
though heâ€™s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his: 1
though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when: 1
though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became: 1
thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in â€™Frisco. Not: 1
thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of: 1

thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs: 1
thought that, as we were a _partie carrÃ©e_, you might have your rubber: 1
thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from: 1
thoughtfully. â€œIt may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if: 1
thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit: 1
threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?â€: 1
threatened.â€: 1
threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the: 1
three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so: 1
three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.: 1
three separate tracks of the same feet.â€ He drew out a lens and lay: 1
three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly: 1
threshold againâ€™â€”here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of: 1
throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my: 1

through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small: 1
through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.â€: 1
through the door; no one hinders.â€™ And then, seeing that I smiled and: 1
through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring: 1
through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring: 1
through.: 1
throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive: 1

time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me: 1
time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even: 1
time of the wifeâ€™s death was little short of Â£ 1,100, is now, through: 1
time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctorâ€”as no: 1
time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectionerâ€™s: 1

to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being: 1
to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems,: 1

was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some: 1

was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.: 1
was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and: 1
was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married: 1

was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company.: 1
was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he: 1
was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.: 1
was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable: 1
was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong,: 1

we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as: 1

what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn,: 1
what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.â€: 1
what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a: 1
what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me: 1
what use the _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be: 1
what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I: 1
what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And: 1
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are: 1

whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew: 1
wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its: 1
wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes: 1
wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.: 1
wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. â€œIf you will be: 1
when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the: 1
when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the: 1
when I saw the door open.â€™: 1
when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I: 1
when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable: 1
when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the fatherâ€™s feet: 1
when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be: 1
when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat,: 1
when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be: 1
when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room.: 1
when she finished speaking to her maid?â€: 1
when she married again so soon after fatherâ€™s death, and a man who was: 1
when the Rucastles went away.â€: 1
when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.: 1
when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery: 1
when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your: 1
when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as: 1
when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain: 1
when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his: 1
when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked: 1
when you address me always to say â€˜sirâ€™ and â€˜please.â€™â€: 1
when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the: 1
when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an: 1
whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her: 1
where I was soon asleep.: 1
where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not: 1
where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no: 1
where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which: 1
where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all: 1
where it went to?â€: 1
where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector: 1
where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I: 1
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND: 1
where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five: 1
where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make: 1
whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the: 1
wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that: 1
whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the: 1
whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was: 1
whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he: 1
whether to claim or to disown it.: 1
whether you had heard it.â€™: 1
which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read,: 1
which I beg that you will give a plain answer.â€: 1
which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it: 1
which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern: 1
which I do not think that any burglar could have done.: 1
which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been: 1
which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that: 1
which I have the honour to bearâ€â€”he gave a little stately coughâ€”â€œhad I: 1
which all this points. The culprit isâ€”â€: 1
which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational,: 1
which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most: 1
which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a: 1
which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.â€: 1
which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there: 1
which crime may be committed there.â€: 1
which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This: 1
which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into: 1
which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was: 1
which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad: 1
which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has: 1
which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of: 1
which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon,: 1
which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you: 1
which he closed upon it.: 1
which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a: 1
which he had promised to bring home.: 1
which he had told me. â€˜I was admiring your fullerâ€™s-earth,â€™ said I; â€˜I: 1
which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his: 1
which he still held in his trembling hand, â€˜K. K. K.!â€™ he shrieked, and: 1
which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into: 1
which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no: 1
which interests me deeply.â€: 1
which is really the only notable feature about the thing.â€: 1
which is the German for â€˜Company.â€™ It is a customary contraction like: 1
which lead up from the hall to this room.â€: 1
which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge.: 1
which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting: 1
which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally: 1
which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me: 1
which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have: 1
which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening: 1
which presented more singular features than that which was associated: 1
which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that: 1
which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the: 1
which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry: 1
which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the: 1
which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his: 1
which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do: 1
which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should: 1
which spoke her joy. â€œI have been waiting so eagerly for you,â€ she: 1
which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained: 1
which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in â€™83. There were: 1
which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner: 1
which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him,: 1
which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed: 1
which was characteristic of him. â€œIt is perhaps less suggestive than it: 1
which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before,: 1
which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.: 1
which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these: 1
which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my: 1
which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the: 1
which wasnâ€™t near as much as father could have got if he had been: 1
which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.: 1
which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the: 1
which would suit them.: 1
which you have stolen?â€™: 1
which you supplied to the Alpha.â€: 1
which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep: 1
while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian: 1
while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in: 1
while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum: 1
whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million: 1

whispered something to her husband.: 1
whispered, â€œWalk past me, and then look back at me.â€ The words fell: 1
whispered, â€˜get away from here before it is too late!â€™: 1
whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and: 1
whistled.: 1

who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the: 1
who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to: 1
who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single: 1
who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in: 1
who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little: 1
who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability: 1
who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he: 1
who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there,: 1
who was it brought him the coronet?: 1
who were in need of it, I came right away to you.â€: 1
whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my: 1
whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The: 1
whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I: 1
whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his: 1
whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold: 1
whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when: 1
whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see: 1
whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I: 1
whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink: 1
whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.: 1
whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I: 1
whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be: 1
why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little: 1
why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitneyâ€™s medical adviser, and as: 1
widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these: 1
widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three: 1
wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also: 1
wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just: 1
wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear: 1
wifeâ€™s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. â€œOh, Iâ€™m in such trouble!â€: 1
wig. Even a wifeâ€™s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But: 1
wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy,: 1

will bring up your coffee.â€: 1
will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the: 1

will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be: 1
will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer: 1
will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.â€: 1
will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I: 1
will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these: 1
will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our: 1
wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.: 1
window is the one that I jumped from.â€: 1
window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed: 1
window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which: 1
window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my: 1
window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden: 1
window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going: 1
window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she: 1
windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as: 1
windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that: 1
winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off,: 1
winking at me. â€œI find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without: 1
wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better: 1
wish to lay your hands.â€: 1
with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California: 1
with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is: 1
with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very: 1

with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a: 1

with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. â€œBeyond the obvious: 1
with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had: 1
with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to: 1

with every nerve in a twitter. â€œI say, Watson, what oâ€™clock is it?â€: 1
with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a: 1

with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my: 1

with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the: 1

with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he: 1
with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee,: 1
with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door,: 1
with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she: 1

with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of: 1

with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the: 1

â€œAh! I donâ€™t know him. Well, hereâ€™s your good health landlord, and: 1

â€œAh, but I was recommended to you.â€: 1
â€œAh, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?â€: 1
â€œAh, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.â€: 1
â€œAh, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,: 1
â€œAh, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just: 1

â€œAh,â€ said Holmes, â€œI think that what you have been good enough to tell: 1
â€œAh,â€ said he, â€œI forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is: 1
â€œAlas!â€ replied our visitor, â€œthe very horror of my situation lies in: 1
â€œAlice is her name. She is an American and came from California with: 1

â€œAll right,â€ said Jones with a stare and a snigger. â€œWell, would you: 1
â€œAlways.â€: 1
â€œAmerican slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do: 1

â€œAn accident, I presume?â€: 1
â€œAn elderly man, I presume?â€ said Holmes.: 1
â€œAn enemy?â€: 1
â€œAnd I am for north,â€ said I, â€œbecause there are no hills there, and: 1
â€œAnd I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case.: 1

â€œAnd did you observe any change in her then?â€: 1
â€œAnd for present expenses?â€: 1
â€œAnd from a noble client?â€: 1
â€œAnd has your business been attended to in your absence?â€: 1
â€œAnd have you any on hand just now?â€ I asked with interest.: 1
â€œAnd he is a man with a wooden leg?â€: 1
â€œAnd help.â€: 1
â€œAnd how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?â€ I: 1
â€œAnd how did he make his money?â€: 1
â€œAnd how did you find out?â€: 1
â€œAnd how did you verify them?â€: 1
â€œAnd how have you succeeded?â€: 1

â€œAnd in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of: 1

â€œAnd it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had: 1
â€œAnd it isâ€”â€: 1
â€œAnd leave your case unfinished?â€: 1
â€œAnd my son? You give me hopes?â€: 1
â€œAnd now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you: 1
â€œAnd now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr.: 1
â€œAnd now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to: 1
â€œAnd now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in: 1
â€œAnd now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when: 1
â€œAnd now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about: 1
â€œAnd now?â€ He raised his hand.: 1
â€œAnd now?â€ I asked.: 1
â€œAnd on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?â€: 1
â€œAnd on what day did he meet his death?â€: 1
â€œAnd one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be: 1
â€œAnd over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill,: 1
â€œAnd she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?â€: 1
â€œAnd she would need to be,â€ said Holmes gravely. â€œI am much mistaken if: 1
â€œAnd sit in the dark?â€: 1
â€œAnd so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to: 1
â€œAnd that isâ€”â€: 1
â€œAnd that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,â€: 1
â€œAnd the cigar-holder?â€: 1
â€œAnd the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,â€ observed Holmes, shading his: 1
â€œAnd the murderer?â€: 1
â€œAnd the papers?â€ asked the King hoarsely. â€œAll is lost.â€: 1
â€œAnd the ring?â€ I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which: 1
â€œAnd then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart: 1
â€œAnd they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the: 1
â€œAnd this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a _fait: 1
â€œAnd very wet it seems to have made you,â€ said Holmes laying his hand: 1
â€œAnd what did you do then?â€ asked Holmes.: 1
â€œAnd what did you learn from him?â€: 1
â€œAnd what did you see?â€: 1
â€œAnd what do you think of it all, Watson?â€ asked Sherlock Holmes,: 1
â€œAnd what else?â€ I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my: 1
â€œAnd what of Irene Adler?â€ I asked.: 1
â€œAnd what then?â€: 1
â€œAnd when I raise my handâ€”soâ€”you will throw into the room what I give: 1
â€œAnd when will you call?â€: 1
â€œAnd where is it?â€ I asked, smiling.: 1
â€œAnd who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for: 1
â€œAnd who is her maid?â€: 1
â€œAnd who is this Captain Calhoun?â€: 1
â€œAnd why did you wish to see me?â€ He looked across at my companion with: 1
â€œAnd why in hopes?â€: 1
â€œAnd why?â€: 2
â€œAnd yet I am not convinced of it,â€ I answered. â€œThe cases which come: 1
â€œAnd yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have: 1
â€œAnd yet,â€ said I, smiling, â€œI cannot quite hold myself absolved from: 1
â€œAnd you are a benefactor of the race,â€ said I.: 1
â€œAnd you are sure that this is your husbandâ€™s hand?â€: 1
â€œAnd you can do nothing until then?â€: 1
â€œAnd you did very wisely,â€ said Holmes. â€œYour case is an exceedingly: 1
â€œAnd you donâ€™t know his address?â€: 1
â€œAnd you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small: 1
â€œAnd you think that they brought you back all that way when you were: 1
â€œAnd you thought he was pulled back?â€: 1
â€œAnd you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?â€: 1
â€œAnd your father? Did you tell him?â€: 1
â€œAnd your father?â€ asked Holmes. â€œWas he in favour of such a union?â€: 1
â€œAnd your mother is alive?â€: 1
â€œAnd, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell: 1
â€œAnyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to: 1
â€œAnything else?â€ asked Holmes, yawning.: 1
â€œAre they not fresh and beautiful?â€ I cried with all the enthusiasm of: 1
â€œAre you, indeed, now?â€ cried Lestrade with some bitterness. â€œI am: 1
â€œArthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.â€: 1
â€œAs I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country,: 1
â€œAs a rule,â€ said Holmes, â€œthe more bizarre a thing is the less: 1
â€œAs far as you are personally concerned,â€ remarked Holmes, â€œI do not: 1
â€œAs it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most: 1
â€œAs long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a: 1
â€œAs low as you can,â€ he answered; â€œI have excellent ears. If you would: 1
â€œAs she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the: 1
â€œAs you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable: 1
â€œAt Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.: 1
â€œAt eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a: 1

â€œAt least,â€ said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the: 1
â€œAt some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.â€: 1
â€œAt the same time,â€ he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat: 1
â€œAt the wedding breakfast.â€: 1
â€œAt what time?â€: 1
â€œAwake, Watson?â€ he asked.: 1
â€œAway they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well: 1
â€œAway we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander: 1
â€œAy, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had Â£ 1000 for every: 1

â€œBecause he was handy and would come cheap.â€: 1
â€œBecause it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If: 1

â€œBecause there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St.: 1
â€œBecause you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one: 1
â€œBefore the what?â€ asked Holmes with a start.: 1
â€œBetter close the front door,â€ cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the: 1

â€œBought.â€: 1

â€œBut I am all in the dark.â€: 1
â€œBut I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what womanâ€™s instincts: 1

â€œBut I have heard that the crocuses promise well,â€ continued my: 1
â€œBut I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.: 1
â€œBut Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,: 1
â€œBut a cripple!â€ said I. â€œWhat could he have done single-handed against: 1
â€œBut a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.: 1
â€œBut a very serious one to me,â€ returned the King reproachfully.: 1
â€œBut have you,â€ I asked, â€œformed any definite conception as to what: 1
â€œBut he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And: 1
â€œBut he might be a bachelor.â€: 1
â€œBut he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.â€: 1
â€œBut his lameness?â€: 1
â€œBut his left-handedness.â€: 1
â€œBut his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was: 1
â€œBut his wifeâ€”you said that she had ceased to love him.â€: 1
â€œBut how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?â€: 1
â€œBut how could you guess what the motive was?â€: 1
â€œBut how did you gain them?â€: 1
â€œBut how will you look?â€: 1
â€œBut how?â€: 2
â€œBut if he is innocent, who has done it?â€: 1
â€œBut it has twice been burgled.â€: 1
â€œBut it is impossible,â€ said Miss Hunter; â€œthe ladder was not there: 1
â€œBut it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue.: 1
â€œBut it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the: 1
â€œBut it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer: 1
â€œBut not more so than I to find you.â€: 1
â€œBut of what society?â€: 1
â€œBut perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss: 1
â€œBut she could not love him.â€: 1
â€œBut she will refuse.â€: 1
â€œBut the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?â€: 1
â€œBut the letter had also a greater distance to come.â€: 1
â€œBut the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!â€: 1
â€œBut the mystery?â€: 1
â€œBut the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do: 1
â€œBut the twelve-mile drive?â€ gasped Hatherley.: 1
â€œBut they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the: 1
â€œBut this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her: 1
â€œBut to whom?â€: 1
â€œBut we canâ€™t all be.â€: 1
â€œBut what harm can there be in that?â€: 1
â€œBut what is it you wish?â€: 1
â€œBut what is that compared with the number of your successes?â€: 1
â€œBut what is the good of all these vague theories,â€ cried the banker: 1
â€œBut what other is there?â€ cried the banker with a gesture of despair.: 1
â€œBut what will you do?â€: 1
â€œBut what, then, did the gipsies do?â€: 1
â€œBut who is he?â€: 1
â€œBut why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?â€ I asked.: 1
â€œBut with no very good result,â€ I remarked. â€œHis conduct was certainly: 1
â€œBut without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.â€: 1
â€œBut you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?â€: 1
â€œBut you can know nothing of this?â€: 1
â€œBut you can understand,â€ said our strange visitor, sitting down once: 1
â€œBut you have hopes?â€: 1
â€œBut you have no notion as to what it could have been?â€: 1
â€œBut you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do: 1
â€œBut you were on a friendly footing?â€: 1
â€œBut you would not advise me to refuse?â€: 1
â€œBut your clientâ€”â€: 1
â€œBut, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested: 1
â€œBy all means.â€: 1
â€œBy no means.â€: 2
â€œBy the same brilliant reasoning, every manâ€™s body is to be found in: 1
â€œBy the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a: 1
â€œBy this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in: 1
â€œBy train from Waterloo.â€: 1
â€œCan I be of assistance?â€: 1
â€œCapital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was: 1
â€œCertainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.â€: 1
â€œCertainly, madam.â€: 1
â€œCertainly, sir,â€ said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained: 1
â€œCertainly,â€ said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the: 1
â€œCertainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count: 1
â€œCertainly.â€: 4
â€œCircumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,â€ answered Holmes: 1
â€œCoarse writing,â€ murmured Holmes. â€œSurely this is not your husbandâ€™s: 1
â€œColonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he: 1
â€œCome in!â€ said Holmes.: 1
â€œCome in!â€ said he.: 1
â€œCome,â€ cried the inspector, laughing; â€œitâ€™s a very pretty diversity of: 1
â€œComing on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least: 1
â€œConvinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the: 1
â€œCooee!â€ which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then: 1
â€œCould he throw no light?â€: 1
â€œDanger! What danger do you foresee?â€: 1
â€œDark enough and sinister enough.â€: 1
â€œDeserted you?â€: 1
â€œDid he not advertise?â€: 1
â€œDid you become engaged then?â€: 1
â€œDid you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?â€: 1
â€œDid you observe the colour?â€: 1
â€œDid your wife hear all this?â€: 1
â€œDirty?â€: 1
â€œDo not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol: 1
â€œDo not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the: 1
â€œDo not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think: 1
â€œDo not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to: 1
â€œDo you go out much in society?â€: 1
â€œDo you know him?â€: 1
â€œDo you know the young lady?â€ I asked.: 1
â€œDo you know, Watson,â€ said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering: 1
â€œDo you know, Watson,â€ said he, â€œthat it is one of the curses of a mind: 1
â€œDo you not find,â€ he said, â€œthat with your short sight it is a little: 1
â€œDo you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten: 1
â€œDo you receive much company?â€ he asked.: 1
â€œDo you think that this man Horner is innocent?â€: 1
â€œDone about the same time as the bell-rope?â€ remarked Holmes.: 1
â€œDr. Becherâ€™s.â€: 1
â€œDâ€™you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them: 1
â€œEh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through: 1
â€œEh? What was that?â€: 1
â€œEight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and: 1
â€œEntirely.â€: 2
â€œEvidently,â€ said I, â€œMr. Wilsonâ€™s assistant counts for a good deal in: 1
â€œExactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.â€: 1
â€œExcellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course: 1
â€œExcellent! You should have been a surgeon.â€: 1
â€œExcellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the: 1
â€œExcellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?â€: 1
â€œExcept yourself I have none,â€ he answered. â€œI do not encourage: 1
â€œExcuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some: 1
â€œExcuse me,â€ he said, â€œbut it is not my custom to discuss my most: 1
â€œExperience,â€ said Holmes, laughing. â€œIndirectly it may be of value,: 1
â€œExtremely so. I congratulate you warmly.â€: 1
â€œFancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official: 1
â€œFarewell, then,â€ said the old man solemnly. â€œYour own deathbeds, when: 1
â€œFarintosh,â€ said he. â€œAh yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with: 1
â€œFine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?â€: 1
â€œFire!â€ Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the: 1
â€œFive attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her: 1
â€œFor Heavenâ€™s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!â€: 1
â€œFor two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very: 1
â€œFrankly, then, madam, I do not.â€: 1
â€œFrequently.â€: 1
â€œFrom East London. What do you deduce from that?â€: 1
â€œFrom Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile,: 1
â€œFrom his hat?â€: 1
â€œFrom the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the: 1
â€œFrom what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very: 1
â€œGame for a morning drive?â€: 1
â€œGet back into your chair!â€ said Holmes sternly. â€œIt is very well to: 1
â€œGet out!â€ said he.: 1
â€œGive me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: â€˜Found at the: 1
â€œGive me your coat and umbrella,â€ said Holmes. â€œThey may rest here on: 1
â€œGod bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it: 1
â€œGod bless you!â€ cried the prisoner passionately. â€œI would have endured: 1
â€œGod help us!â€ said Holmes after a long silence. â€œWhy does fate play: 1
â€œGod knows I have!â€”a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so: 1
â€œGood God! What a week she must have spent!â€: 1
â€œGood God!â€ I cried. â€œWhat can it mean, this relentless persecution?â€: 1
â€œGood heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What dâ€™you: 1
â€œGood heavens!â€ I cried, â€œthis is a terrible injury. It must have bled: 1
â€œGood heavens!â€ I cried. â€œWho would associate crime with these dear old: 1
â€œGood heavens!â€ cried my patient. â€œThen that explains what the girl: 1
â€œGood heavens!â€ she cried, â€œhe has followed me, then.â€: 1
â€œGood-day, Lord St. Simon,â€ said Holmes, rising and bowing. â€œPray take: 1
â€œGood-evening, Mr. James Windibank,â€ said Holmes. â€œI think that this: 1
â€œGood-evening. Itâ€™s a cold night,â€ said Holmes.: 1
â€œGood-morning, madam,â€ said Holmes cheerily. â€œMy name is Sherlock: 1
â€œGood-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.â€: 1
â€œGrave enough!â€ said Mr. Jabez Wilson. â€œWhy, I have lost four pound a: 1
â€œGreat heavens!â€ cried the inspector, â€œit is, indeed, the missing man.: 1
â€œHUNTER.â€: 1
â€œHa! In Victoria! That is important.â€: 1
â€œHa! Our party is complete,â€ said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket: 1
â€œHa! You put me off, do you?â€ said our new visitor, taking a step: 1
â€œHa! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned: 1
â€œHa! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the: 1
â€œHa! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,â€ whispered Holmes. â€œCome: 1
â€œHa! you find it so?â€: 1
â€œHa!â€ cried I, â€œif it is anything in the nature of a problem which you: 1
â€œHa!â€ said Holmes, looking keenly at her. â€œIt is clear that Mrs. Toller: 1
â€œHad he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?â€: 1
â€œHad he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?â€: 1
â€œHad there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere: 1
â€œHalf dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.: 1
â€œHas he come with you to-night?â€: 1
â€œHave they thought of looking outside the house?â€: 1
â€œHave you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the: 1
â€œHave you an order to see him in prison?â€: 1
â€œHave you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?â€ he asked.: 1
â€œHave you heard anything of the case?â€ he asked.: 1
â€œHave you her photograph?â€: 1
â€œHave you it here?â€: 1
â€œHave you managed it?â€ asked Holmes.: 1
â€œHave you neverâ€”â€ said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his: 1
â€œHaving once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew: 1
â€œHe brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,: 1
â€œHe canâ€™t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?â€: 1
â€œHe certainly needs a wash,â€ remarked Holmes. â€œI had an idea that he: 1
â€œHe didnâ€™t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time: 1
â€œHe disappeared so suddenly.â€: 1
â€œHe had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.â€: 1
â€œHe has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and: 1
â€œHe has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,â€ he continued,: 1
â€œHe investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylottâ€™s conduct: 1
â€œHe is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other: 1
â€œHe is asleep,â€ said he. â€œYou can see him very well.â€: 1
â€œHe is dead,â€ cried several voices.: 1
â€œHe is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.â€: 1
â€œHe is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will: 1
â€œHe is still with you, I presume?â€: 1
â€œHe knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview: 1
â€œHe looked inside the envelope. â€˜So it is,â€™ he cried. â€˜Here are the: 1
â€œHe looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my: 1
â€œHe looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had: 1
â€œHe might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?â€: 1
â€œHe might.â€: 1
â€œHe must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more: 1
â€œHe often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what: 1
â€œHe only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?â€: 1
â€œHe said that you could solve anything.â€: 1
â€œHe said too much.â€: 1
â€œHe says four oâ€™clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.â€: 1
â€œHe seems a very amiable person,â€ said Holmes, laughing. â€œI am not: 1
â€œHe shot one of his suspicious looks at me. â€˜Perhaps we had better: 1
â€œHe slept on the premises.â€: 1
â€œHe stood,â€ said Holmes, â€œto the left of the doorâ€”that is to say,: 1
â€œHe travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of: 1
â€œHe was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the: 1
â€œHe was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of: 1
â€œHe! he! You are a funny one,â€ chuckled the inspector.: 1
â€œHer banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am: 1
â€œHer father is very rich?â€: 1
â€œHere is a very fashionable epistle,â€ I remarked as he entered. â€œYour: 1
â€œHere is an advertisement which will interest you,â€ said he. â€œIt: 1
â€œHere is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as: 1
â€œHere is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal: 1
â€œHere we are!â€ said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. â€œThe: 1
â€œHere?â€: 2
â€œHeâ€™s a beauty, isnâ€™t he?â€ said the inspector.: 1
â€œHeâ€™s a brave fellow,â€ said a woman. â€œThey would have had the ladyâ€™s: 1
â€œHeâ€™s gone for the dog!â€ cried Miss Hunter.: 1
â€œHis face fell immediately.: 1
â€œHis hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing,: 1
â€œHis height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his: 1
â€œHis name is Vincent Spaulding, and heâ€™s not such a youth, either. Itâ€™s: 1
â€œHis son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known: 1
â€œHolmes!â€ I whispered, â€œwhat on earth are you doing in this den?â€: 1
â€œHolmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!â€: 1
â€œHolmes, the busybody!â€: 1
â€œHolmes,â€ I cried, â€œI seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are: 1
â€œHolmes,â€ I cried, â€œyou are too late.â€: 1
â€œHolmes,â€ I said, â€œyou have drawn a net round this man from which he: 1
â€œHolmes,â€ said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down: 1
â€œHotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was: 1
â€œHow about poison?â€: 1
â€œHow are you getting on?â€: 1
â€œHow can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in: 1
â€œHow can you tell that?â€: 1
â€œHow could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the: 1
â€œHow did he come?â€: 1
â€œHow did that help you?â€: 1
â€œHow did you deduce the select?â€: 1
â€œHow did you trace it, then?â€: 1
â€œHow do you know, then?â€: 1
â€œHow is that?â€ I asked when I had finished.: 1
â€œHow is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the: 1
â€œHow long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a: 1
â€œHow long did she speak to this Alice?â€: 1
â€œHow many? I donâ€™t know.â€: 1
â€œHow often?â€: 1
â€œHow on earthâ€”â€: 1
â€œHow very absurd! I never noticed that before.â€: 1
â€œHow, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?â€: 1
â€œHum! So much for the police-court,â€ said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing: 1
â€œHum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of: 1
â€œHum!â€ said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. â€œHe is still with: 1
â€œI advertised for him in last Saturdayâ€™s _Chronicle_,â€ said she. â€œHere: 1
â€œI am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.â€: 1
â€œI am Mr. Holmes,â€ answered my companion, looking at her with a: 1
â€œI am a dying man,â€ said old Turner. â€œI have had diabetes for years. My: 1
â€œI am about to be married.â€: 1
â€œI am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I: 1
â€œI am afraid that you will find it difficult.â€: 1
â€œI am afraid the doctor wonâ€™t allow it.â€: 1
â€œI am afraid,â€ said I, â€œthat the facts are so obvious that you will: 1
â€œI am all attention, madam.â€: 1
â€œI am armed.â€: 1
â€œI am ashamed of you, Holmes,â€ said Lestrade with dignity after a few: 1
â€œI am delighted to see you,â€ said she, pressing my hand warmly. â€œYou: 1
â€œI am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have: 1
â€œI am following you closely,â€ I answered.: 1
â€œI am for west,â€ remarked the plain-clothes man. â€œThere are several: 1
â€œI am glad of all details,â€ remarked my friend, â€œwhether they seem to: 1
â€œI am glad to hear you say so,â€ said Holmes gravely.: 1
â€œI am glad to hear your Majesty say so.â€: 1
â€œI am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward: 1
â€œI am in hopes that she does.â€: 1
â€œI am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I: 1
â€œI am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who: 1
â€œI am so delighted that you have come,â€ she said earnestly. â€œIt is so: 1
â€œI am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,â€ said he, â€œbut I have had: 1
â€œI am still in the dark.â€: 1
â€œI am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,â€ cried our client. â€œA: 1
â€œI am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,â€ said Holmes, â€œfor you: 1
â€œI am sure.â€: 1
â€œI am to be neutral?â€: 1
â€œI am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at: 1
â€œI am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,: 1
â€œI answered that I had not.: 1
â€œI assure you that I am in your hands.â€: 1
â€œI assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my: 1
â€œI assured him that I was not offended. â€˜By the way,â€™ said I, â€˜you seem: 1
â€œI beg pardon.â€: 1
â€œI beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with: 1
â€œI beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,â€ remarked our: 1
â€œI begin to think, Watson,â€ said Holmes, â€œthat I make a mistake in: 1
â€œI believe that he is coming here,â€ said Holmes, rubbing his hands.: 1
â€œI believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,â€ said: 1
â€œI bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an: 1
â€œI brought this with me.â€ He opened a locket and showed us the full: 1
â€œI called about that beggarman, Booneâ€”the one who was charged with: 1
â€œI came to find a friend.â€: 1
â€œI came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose: 1
â€œI can see nothing,â€ said I, handing it back to my friend.: 1
â€œI cannot admire his taste,â€ I remarked, â€œif it is indeed a fact that: 1
â€œI cannot as yet see any connection.â€: 1
â€œI cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.â€: 1
â€œI cannot imagine.â€: 2
â€œI cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,â€ I: 1
â€œI cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to: 1
â€œI cannot say that I have.â€: 1
â€œI cannot see that there is anything very funny,â€ cried our client,: 1
â€œI cannot tell.â€: 2
â€œI cannot think.â€: 1
â€œI cannot, and I will not, believe it!â€ cried the banker with an ashen: 1
â€œI canâ€™t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and: 1
â€œI come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be: 1
â€œI confess that I still share my uncleâ€™s perplexity.â€: 1
â€œI confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a: 1
â€œI could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand: 1
â€œI could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my: 1
â€œI could hardly imagine a more damning case,â€ I remarked. â€œIf ever: 1
â€œI could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune: 1
â€œI could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used: 1
â€œI did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down: 1
â€œI did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step: 1
â€œI did at first,â€ she answered, â€œbut now I know where the letters are: 1
â€œI did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast: 1
â€œI did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this: 1
â€œI didnâ€™t know what to do, so I came straight to you.â€ That was always: 1
â€œI do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was: 1
â€œI do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,â€ said he.: 1
â€œI do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.â€: 1
â€œI do not think Flora would hurt a fly.â€: 1
â€œI do not wish to make a mystery,â€ said he, laughing. â€œThe matter was: 1
â€œI do.â€: 1
â€œI donâ€™t believe it.â€: 1
â€œI donâ€™t say that. Perhaps.â€: 1
â€œI fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady: 1
â€œI fear not.â€: 1
â€œI feel that time is of value,â€ said he; â€œthat is why I hastened here: 1
â€œI felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that: 1
â€œI fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or: 1
â€œI fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove: 1
â€œI glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of: 1
â€œI guessed as much.â€: 1
â€œI had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just: 1
â€œI had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An: 1
â€œI had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent: 1
â€œI had hoped,â€ suggested Holmes, â€œthat you would have joined us in a: 1
â€œI had,â€ said he, â€œcome to an entirely erroneous conclusion which: 1
â€œI hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the: 1
â€œI hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my: 1
â€œI have a cab outside.â€: 1
â€œI have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could: 1
â€œI have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.â€: 1
â€œI have been a governess for five years,â€ said she, â€œin the family of: 1
â€œI have been beaten four timesâ€”three times by men, and once by a: 1
â€œI have been making a fool of myself,â€ he gasped.: 1
â€œI have come for advice.â€: 1
â€œI have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover: 1
â€œI have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John: 1
â€œI have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how: 1
â€œI have hopes.â€: 1
â€œI have my revolver,â€ said I.: 1
â€œI have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has: 1
â€œI have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am: 1
â€œI have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked: 1
â€œI have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.â€: 1
â€œI have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in: 1
â€œI have ordered a carriage,â€ said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea.: 1
â€œI have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls: 1
â€œI have seen the police.â€: 1
â€œI have seen the will of the deceased wife,â€ said he. â€œTo determine its: 1
â€œI have seen those symptoms before,â€ said Holmes, throwing his: 1
â€œI have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be: 1
â€œI have solved it.â€: 1
â€œI have spent the whole day,â€ said he, â€œover Lloydâ€™s registers and: 1
â€œI have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.â€: 1
â€œI have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long: 1
â€œI have very little difficulty in finding what I want,â€ said I, â€œfor: 1
â€œI hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and: 1
â€œI hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,â€: 1
â€œI hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. Iâ€™ve: 1
â€œI hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,â€ said Sherlock Holmes. â€œYou may: 1
â€œI knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke: 1
â€œI knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until: 1
â€œI know where it is.â€: 1
â€œI looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague: 1
â€œI make nothing of it,â€ I answered frankly. â€œIt is a most mysterious: 1
â€œI may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can: 1
â€œI must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I: 1
â€œI must really ask you to be a little more quiet!â€ said Holmes: 1
â€œI never have.â€: 1
â€œI never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From: 1
â€œI noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home: 1
â€œI only looked in as I passed,â€ said he. â€œI am going right on.â€: 1
â€œI owe you an apology,â€ he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his: 1
â€œI perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and: 1
â€œI pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?â€: 1
â€œI promise,â€ said Holmes.: 1
â€œI reached this one,â€ said my friend, â€œby sitting upon five pillows and: 1
â€œI really donâ€™t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at: 1
â€œI really have made no inquiries on the subject.â€: 1
â€œI saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,â€ said Mr.: 1
â€œI saw her in conversation with her maid.â€: 1
â€œI saw it in a paper,â€ explained the American. â€œIt gave the name and: 1
â€œI saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that: 1
â€œI say it is.â€: 1
â€œI say that I have solved it.â€: 1
â€œI searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque _Lone: 1
â€œI see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting: 1
â€œI see many objections to any such theory.â€: 1
â€œI see no marks.â€: 1
â€œI see that you have had some great trouble,â€ responded Holmes.: 1
â€œI see,â€ said I as I glanced down the column, â€œthat the coroner in his: 1
â€œI see. Then at the gasfittersâ€™ ball you met, as I understand, a: 1
â€œI see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart,: 1
â€œI seeâ€”her ladyshipâ€™s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden: 1
â€œI shall be at Baker Street at ten.â€: 1
â€œI shall be delighted.â€: 1
â€œI shall glance into the case for you,â€ said Holmes, rising, â€œand I: 1
â€œI shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get: 1
â€œI shall most certainly do so.â€: 1
â€œI shall never let it drop until the gems are foundâ€”never, Mary! Your: 1
â€œI shall see you at Horsham, then?â€: 1
â€œI shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant: 1
â€œI should be immensely obliged to you.â€: 1
â€œI should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one: 1
â€œI should be very glad now to go upstairs,â€ said he. â€œI shall probably: 1
â€œI should like to see him very much.â€: 1
â€œI should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.â€: 1
â€œI should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to: 1
â€œI should wish to.â€: 1
â€œI signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him.: 1
â€œI started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a: 1
â€œI suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business: 1
â€œI suppose, Watson,â€ said he, â€œthat you imagine that I have added: 1
â€œI suppose,â€ said Holmes, â€œthat when Mr. Windibank came back from: 1
â€œI tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to: 1
â€œI tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two: 1
â€œI thank you,â€ said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat.: 1
â€œI thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter.: 1
â€œI then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there: 1
â€œI think I could lay my finger on it,â€ said Holmes quietly.: 1
â€œI think it very unlikely.â€: 1
â€œI think that I had better go, Holmes.â€: 1
â€œI think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,â€: 1
â€œI think that I heard a ring,â€ said Holmes. â€œYes, there are steps on: 1
â€œI think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a: 1
â€œI think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,â€ said Holmes.: 1
â€œI think that it is very probable.â€: 1
â€œI think that there you ask a little too much,â€ responded his Lordship.: 1
â€œI think that this should do,â€ said he, glancing into the glass above: 1
â€œI think that we may safely say,â€ returned Holmes, â€œthat she is: 1
â€œI think you will find,â€ said Sherlock Holmes, â€œthat you will play for: 1
â€œI think, Watson,â€ he remarked at last, â€œthat of all our cases we have: 1
â€œI thought it as well,â€ said Holmes as we climbed the stile, â€œthat this: 1
â€œI thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be: 1
â€œI thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.â€: 1
â€œI thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand: 1
â€œI told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.â€: 1
â€œI took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and: 1
â€œI took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly.: 1
â€œI took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity: 1
â€œI trust that we are not too late,â€ said he. â€œI think, Miss Hunter,: 1
â€œI want to test a little theory of mine,â€ said he, pulling on his: 1
â€œI warn you that they are very incomplete.â€: 1
â€œI was a little startled at the nature of the childâ€™s amusement, but: 1
â€œI was afraid that you were engaged.â€: 1
â€œI was also aware of that,â€ murmured Holmes, settling himself down in: 1
â€œI was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.â€: 1
â€œI was aware of it,â€ said Holmes dryly.: 1
â€œI was certainly surprised to find you there.â€: 1
â€œI was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was: 1
â€œI was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I: 1
â€œI was madâ€”insane.â€: 1
â€œI was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an: 1
â€œI was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.â€: 1
â€œI was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I: 1
â€œI was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and: 1
â€œI was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I: 1
â€œI was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the: 1
â€œI was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up: 1
â€œI was sure that I might rely on you.â€: 1
â€œI was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. â€˜You: 1
â€œI went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my: 1
â€œI will do it.â€: 1
â€œI will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have: 1
â€œI will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to: 1
â€œI will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And: 1
â€œI will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge: 1
â€œI will get her to show me.â€: 1
â€œI will go when I have had my say. Donâ€™t you dare to meddle with my: 1
â€œI will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been: 1
â€œI will not look.â€: 1
â€œI will soon make it clear to you,â€ said she; â€œand Iâ€™d have done so: 1
â€œI will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your: 1
â€œI will try. What is it?â€: 1
â€œI will, Miss Turner.â€: 1
â€œI wired to Bristol for it last night.â€ He put his hand over part of: 1
â€œI wonâ€™t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,: 1
â€œI would give my fortune to have them back.â€: 1
â€œI would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would: 1
â€œI would pay ten.â€: 1
â€œI wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some: 1
â€œIf I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has: 1
â€œIf I can be of use.â€: 1
â€œIf I may give an opinion,â€ remarked the strange gentleman, â€œweâ€™ve had: 1
â€œIf I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old: 1
â€œIf his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?â€: 1
â€œIf so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on: 1
â€œIf so, much may have happened between.â€: 1
â€œIf you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning: 1
â€œIf you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,â€ said he,: 1
â€œIf you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair: 1
â€œIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,â€ he remarked, â€œI: 1
â€œImitated.â€: 1
â€œIn Heavenâ€™s name, what for?â€: 1
â€œIn San Francisco, a year ago.â€: 1
â€œIn answer to an advertisement.â€: 1
â€œIn mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,: 1
â€œIn search of the body of Lady St. Simon.â€: 1
â€œIn short, that she had become suddenly deranged?â€: 1
â€œIn that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come: 1
â€œIn that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be: 1
â€œIn the bathroom,â€ he answered. â€œOh, yes, I am not joking,â€ he: 1
â€œIn the cells.â€: 1
â€œIn the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the: 1
â€œIn the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no: 1
â€œIn the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your: 1
â€œIn this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I: 1
â€œIn view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will: 1
â€œIn what way?â€ asked Holmes.: 1
â€œIn which, sir?â€: 1
â€œIn your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?â€: 1
â€œIndeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left: 1
â€œIndeed! That is interesting,â€ said Holmes.: 1
â€œIndeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?â€: 1
â€œIndeed! Whose, then?â€: 1
â€œIndeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the: 1
â€œIndeed, Doctor,â€ said Holmes blandly. â€œPray take a seat.â€: 1
â€œIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I: 1
â€œIndeed, it is a likely ruse enough,â€ observed Bradstreet thoughtfully.: 1
â€œIndeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You: 1
â€œIndeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,â€ said: 1
â€œIndeed,â€ said Holmes. â€œWas it your custom always to lock yourselves in: 1
â€œIndeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite: 1
â€œIndeed? I know some of them. Which was it?â€: 1
â€œInspector Bradstreet, sir.â€: 1
â€œIrene Adler is married,â€ remarked Holmes.: 1
â€œIreneâ€™s photograph!â€ he cried. â€œCertainly, if you wish it.â€: 1
â€œIs Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. Johnâ€™s Wood.â€: 1
â€œIs Toller still drunk?â€ he asked.: 1
â€œIs a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears: 1
â€œIs he quiet?â€: 1
â€œIs it possible?â€ gasped the banker.: 1
â€œIs such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, â€˜sent the: 1
â€œIs the poor gentleman much hurt?â€ she asked.: 1
â€œIs there a cellar with a good strong lock?â€: 1
â€œIt appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the: 1
â€œIt came here.â€: 1
â€œIt certainly sounds feasible.â€: 1
â€œIt goes to the housekeeperâ€™s room.â€: 1
â€œIt has been a case of considerable interest,â€ he remarked, returning: 1
â€œIt has been in some points a singular case,â€ said Holmes, flicking the: 1
â€œIt is _The Morning Chronicle_ of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.â€: 1
â€œIt is a curious thing,â€ remarked Holmes, â€œthat a typewriter has really: 1
â€œIt is a little cold for the time of the year,â€ said Holmes.: 1
â€œIt is a murder, then?â€: 1
â€œIt is a nice household,â€ he murmured. â€œThat is the baboon.â€: 1
â€œIt is a noiseless lock,â€ said he. â€œIt is no wonder that it did not: 1
â€œIt is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own: 1
â€œIt is a swamp adder!â€ cried Holmes; â€œthe deadliest snake in India. He: 1
â€œIt is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,: 1
â€œIt is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the: 1
â€œIt is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is: 1
â€œIt is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr.: 1
â€œIt is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.â€ She raised her veil as she: 1
â€œIt is for me to ask you that,â€ he shrieked, â€œyou thieves! Spies and: 1
â€œIt is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read: 1
â€œIt is half-past ten now.â€: 1
â€œIt is his hat.â€: 1
â€œIt is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet: 1
â€œIt is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though: 1
â€œIt is no ordinary one.â€: 1
â€œIt is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many: 1
â€œIt is not cold which makes me shiver,â€ said the woman in a low voice,: 1
â€œIt is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you: 1
â€œIt is nothing very formidable,â€ he said, taking a long cigar-shaped: 1
â€œIt is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down: 1
â€œIt is our French gold,â€ whispered the director. â€œWe have had several: 1
â€œIt is our task to find that out,â€ replied Holmes; â€œso now, if you: 1
â€œIt is possible.â€: 2
â€œIt is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted: 1
â€œIt is really very good of you to come, Watson,â€ said he. â€œIt makes a: 1
â€œIt is simplicity itself,â€ said he; â€œmy eyes tell me that on the inside: 1
â€œIt is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.â€: 1
â€œIt is solved.â€: 1
â€œIt is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese: 1
â€œIt is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any: 1
â€œIt is to him that this trophy belongs.â€: 1
â€œIt is true that I have been generally successful.â€: 1
â€œIt is true. And yetâ€”! Well! I wish she had been of my own station!: 1
â€œIt is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor: 1
â€œIt is very clear.â€: 1
â€œIt is very essential, Miss Stoner,â€ said he, â€œthat you should: 1
â€œIt is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a: 1
â€œIt is very kind of you.â€: 1
â€œIt is wonderful!â€ I exclaimed.: 1
â€œIt is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though: 1
â€œIt is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely: 1
â€œIt is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking: 1
â€œIt looks like it,â€ said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the: 1
â€œIt looks newer than the other things?â€: 1
â€œIt may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,â€ said he, â€œbut if you are so: 1
â€œIt may not come to that,â€ said Holmes.: 1
â€œIt may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember: 1
â€œIt means that it is all over,â€ Holmes answered. â€œAnd perhaps, after: 1
â€œIt might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in: 1
â€œIt missed him, then?â€: 1
â€œIt must be recovered.â€: 1
â€œIt must stop here, however,â€ said Bradstreet. â€œIf the police are to: 1
â€œIt saved me from ennui,â€ he answered, yawning. â€œAlas! I already feel: 1
â€œIt seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful: 1
â€œIt seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,â€ I: 1
â€œIt seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,â€ said: 1
â€œIt seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.â€: 1
â€œIt surprised me.â€: 1
â€œIt was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,â€ said he in a crackling: 1
â€œIt was a confession,â€ I ejaculated.: 1
â€œIt was a slight, sir, a public slight,â€ said Lord St. Simon, tapping: 1
â€œIt was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,: 1
â€œIt was an hourâ€™s good drive.â€: 1
â€œIt was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that: 1
â€œIt was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which: 1
â€œIt was in January, â€™85, that my poor father met his end, and two years: 1
â€œIt was in the early â€™60â€™s at the diggings. I was a young chap then,: 1
â€œIt was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I: 1
â€œIt was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,â€ I: 1
â€œIt was most suggestive,â€ said Holmes. â€œIt has long been an axiom of: 1
â€œIt was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my: 1
â€œIt was not the wife; it was the children,â€ groaned the prisoner. â€œGod: 1
â€œIt was only a joke at first,â€ groaned our visitor. â€œWe never thought: 1
â€œIt was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,: 1
â€œIt was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about: 1
â€œIt was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to: 1
â€œIt was very nice and complimentary of you,â€ Holmes answered. â€œIt is: 1
â€œIt was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and: 1
â€œIt was.â€: 1
â€œIt will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may: 1
â€œItâ€™s a common enough lash. But I donâ€™t know why it should be tied.â€: 1
â€œItâ€™s a new patient,â€ he whispered. â€œI thought Iâ€™d bring him round: 1
â€œItâ€™s all clear,â€ he whispered. â€œHave you the chisel and the bags?: 1
â€œItâ€™s as well,â€ said the old man; â€œitâ€™s a question whether I shall live: 1
â€œItâ€™s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But Iâ€™ll: 1
â€œItâ€™s more than a precious stone. It is _the_ precious stone.â€: 1
â€œItâ€™s no use, John Clay,â€ said Holmes blandly. â€œYou have no chance at: 1
â€œItâ€™s nothing of the kind.â€: 1
â€œItâ€™s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed: 1
â€œIâ€™ll do better. Iâ€™ll take you round to him myself.â€: 1
â€œIâ€™ve got him here,â€ he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder;: 1
â€œIâ€™ve had enough of you and your geese,â€ he shouted. â€œI wish you were: 1
â€œIâ€™ve heard that voice before,â€ said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit: 1
â€œIâ€™ve wasted time enough,â€ said Lestrade, rising. â€œI believe in hard: 1
â€œJABEZ WILSONâ€ in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the: 1
â€œJohn Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. Heâ€™s a young man,: 1
â€œJust look it up, then.â€: 1
â€œJust look up the trains in Bradshaw,â€ said he, and turned back to his: 1
â€œJust one hint to you, Lestrade,â€ drawled Holmes before his rival: 1
â€œKindly look her up in my index, Doctor,â€ murmured Holmes without: 1
â€œLady St. Simon said something about â€˜jumping a claim.â€™ She was: 1
â€œLady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful: 1
â€œLast Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room: 1
â€œLast Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than: 1
â€œLast week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream,: 1
â€œLet me introduce you,â€ he shouted, â€œto Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee,: 1
â€œLet me see!â€ said Holmes. â€œHum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.: 1
â€œLet me see,â€ said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along: 1
â€œLet us have everything in its due order.â€ Holmes thrust his long thin: 1
â€œLet you have five hundred to-morrow morning.â€: 1
â€œLook here, Watson,â€ he said when the cloth was cleared â€œjust sit down: 1
â€œLook there!â€ said he.: 1
â€œLord Robert St. Simon,â€ announced our page-boy, throwing open the: 1
â€œLord St. Simon,â€ said he â€œallow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs.: 1
â€œMany times; but what was a fine to me?â€: 1
â€œMarried! When?â€: 1
â€œMay I see it?â€: 1
â€œMiss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.â€: 1
â€œMore than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of: 1
â€œMost certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some: 1
â€œMr. Angelâ€™s address you never had, I understand. Where is your: 1
â€œMr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,â€ said Mrs.: 1
â€œMr. Henry Baker, I believe,â€ said he, rising from his armchair and: 1
â€œMr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should: 1
â€œMr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and: 1
â€œMr. John Turner,â€ cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our: 1
â€œMr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?â€ said she.: 1
â€œMrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Roadâ€”249,â€ read Holmes.: 1
â€œMrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in: 1
â€œMrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window,: 1
â€œMrs. Toller!â€ cried Miss Hunter.: 1
â€œMurdered?â€: 1
â€œMy God! Itâ€™s Watson,â€ said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction,: 1
â€œMy God!â€ I whispered; â€œdid you see it?â€: 1
â€œMy God!â€ he cried. â€œSomeone has loosed the dog. Itâ€™s not been fed for: 1
â€œMy Mary? Impossible!â€: 1
â€œMy cabby drove fast. I donâ€™t think I ever drove faster, but the others: 1
â€œMy dear Holmes!â€: 3
â€œMy dear Holmes,â€ said I, â€œthis is too much. You would certainly have: 1
â€œMy dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as: 1
â€œMy dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are: 1
â€œMy dear fellow, I congratulate you.â€: 1
â€œMy dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which: 1
â€œMy dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.â€: 1
â€œMy dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears: 1
â€œMy dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that â€˜For Mrs.: 1
â€œMy dear fellow,â€ said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the: 1
â€œMy dear madam,â€ said I, â€œI am an old campaigner, and if I were not I: 1
â€œMy eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading â€˜Tragedy Near: 1
â€œMy face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not: 1
â€œMy geese!â€ The man seemed surprised.: 1
â€œMy heart had turned to lead. â€˜It is K. K. K.,â€™ said I.: 1
â€œMy last client of the sort was a king.â€: 1
â€œMy messenger reached you, then?â€ asked Holmes.: 1
â€œMy name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is: 1
â€œMy name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other: 1
â€œMy name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,â€ said my companion: 1
â€œMy name,â€ answered our visitor, â€œis probably familiar to your ears. I: 1
â€œMy name,â€ said he, â€œis John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far: 1
â€œMy opinion is in no way altered.â€: 1
â€œMy own seal.â€: 1
â€œMy photograph.â€: 1
â€œMy private note-paper.â€: 1
â€œMy sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of: 1
â€œMy stepfatherâ€™s business papers.â€: 1
â€œMy uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became: 1
â€œNay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.: 1
â€œNear Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.â€: 1
â€œNearly eleven.â€: 1
â€œNever better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future: 1
â€œNever mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.: 1
â€œNever mind,â€ said Holmes, laughing; â€œit is my business to know things.: 1
â€œNever to return.â€: 1
â€œNever.â€: 2
â€œNo bad?â€: 1
â€œNo crime, but a very great error has been committed,â€ said Holmes.: 1
â€œNo doubt you think me mad?â€ said he.: 1
â€œNo good news?â€: 1
â€œNo legal papers or certificates?â€: 1
â€œNo more words. Get out!â€: 1
â€œNo sign of it?â€: 1
â€œNo, I am descending.â€: 1
â€œNo, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more: 1
â€œNo, I donâ€™t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies: 1
â€œNo, I had a dozen.â€: 1
â€œNo, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my: 1
â€œNo, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we: 1
â€œNo, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid: 1
â€œNo, I think that Iâ€™ll take it.â€: 1
â€œNo, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then,: 1
â€œNo, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that: 1
â€œNo, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of: 1
â€œNo, but the enclosure is.â€: 1
â€œNo, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the: 1
â€œNo, distinctly professional.â€: 1
â€œNo, finished.â€: 1
â€œNo, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.â€: 1
â€œNo, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of: 1
â€œNo, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the: 1
â€œNo, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You: 1
â€œNo, it is not selfishness or conceit,â€ said he, answering, as was his: 1
â€œNo, my brougham is waiting.â€: 1
â€œNo, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look: 1
â€œNo, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.â€: 1
â€œNo, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution.: 1
â€œNo, no, the mystery!â€ I cried.: 1
â€œNo, no, thereâ€™s life in him!â€ shouted another. â€œBut heâ€™ll be gone: 1
â€œNo, no,â€ cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he: 1
â€œNo, no. No crime,â€ said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. â€œOnly one of those: 1
â€œNo, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a: 1
â€œNo, no; it is, it is his very own writing!â€: 1
â€œNo, no; the real name,â€ said Holmes sweetly. â€œIt is always awkward: 1
â€œNo, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the: 1
â€œNo, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that: 1
â€œNo, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what: 1
â€œNo, thank goodness, she did not.â€: 1
â€œNo, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which: 1
â€œNo, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble: 1
â€œNo, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.â€: 1
â€œNo. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.â€: 1
â€œNo. His orders were to stay in the house.â€: 1
â€œNo. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.â€: 1
â€œNo. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They: 1
â€œNo. What a strange idea!â€: 1
â€œNo.â€: 5
â€œNo; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take: 1
â€œNo; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable: 1
â€œNo; but one of them was mine all the same,â€ whined the little man.: 1
â€œNo; we donâ€™t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.â€: 1
â€œNo?â€: 1
â€œNone at all,â€ said Holmes. â€œThey are coiners on a large scale, and: 1
â€œNone at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had: 1
â€œNone of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.â€: 1
â€œNone save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of: 1
â€œNone. Neville wrote those words.â€: 1
â€œNone.â€: 4
â€œNor from below,â€ said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the: 1
â€œNor running a chance of arrest?â€: 1
â€œNot I.â€: 1
â€œNot a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.: 1
â€œNot a bite. I had no time to think of it.â€: 1
â€œNot a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.â€: 1
â€œNot at all. Drink this.â€ I dashed some brandy into the water, and the: 1
â€œNot at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my: 1
â€œNot at all. The â€˜Gâ€™ with the small â€˜tâ€™ stands for â€˜Gesellschaft,â€™: 1
â€œNot at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper: 1
â€œNot him.â€: 1
â€œNot in a good cause.â€: 1
â€œNot in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these: 1
â€œNot in the least.â€: 1
â€œNot invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look,: 1
â€œNot only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat: 1
â€œNot particularly.â€: 1
â€œNot social, then?â€: 1
â€œNot the Countess of Morcarâ€™s blue carbuncle!â€ I ejaculated.: 1
â€œNot yet.â€: 1
â€œNothing to complain of, sir. Thereâ€™s never very much to do of a: 1
â€œNothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and: 1
â€œNothing.â€: 3
â€œNothing?â€: 2
â€œNow a pawnbrokerâ€™s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes,: 1
â€œNow for Mr. Breckinridge,â€ he continued, buttoning up his coat as we: 1
â€œNow then, Mr. Cocksure,â€ said the salesman, â€œI thought that I was out: 1
â€œNow, Mr. Holder,â€ said Holmes, â€œhere is the corner which corresponds: 1
â€œNow, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I: 1
â€œNow, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,â€ said the lady as we entered a well-lit: 1
â€œNow, Watson,â€ said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the: 1
â€œNow, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very: 1
â€œNow, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my: 1
â€œNow, my dear sir,â€ said Holmes, â€œis it not obvious to you now that: 1
â€œNow, then, mister,â€ said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo,: 1
â€œNow, then, whatâ€™s the last entry?â€: 1
â€œNow, what is your own impression as to the young ladyâ€™sâ€”your wifeâ€™s: 1
â€œNoâ€”except that it was Leadenhall Street.â€: 1
â€œOf Friday, June 19th.â€: 1
â€œOf course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.â€: 1
â€œOf course you are. Youâ€™ll know all about it presently. Jump up here.: 1
â€œOf course! Very right! very right! Iâ€™m sure I beg pardon. As to my own: 1
â€œOf course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your: 1
â€œOf what day?â€: 1
â€œOf what?â€: 1
â€œOh! you have seen inside, then?â€: 1
â€œOh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a: 1
â€œOh, I have heard of that fellow,â€ answered my visitor, â€œand I should: 1
â€œOh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the: 1
â€œOh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!â€ she cried, glancing from one to the other of: 1
â€œOh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.â€: 1
â€œOh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.: 1
â€œOh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my: 1
â€œOh, certainly, certainly,â€ answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.: 1
â€œOh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.â€ He put out his hand: 1
â€œOh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.â€: 1
â€œOh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an: 1
â€œOh, fresh and glossy.â€: 1
â€œOh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.â€: 1
â€œOh, he has his faults, too,â€ said Mr. Wilson. â€œNever was such a fellow: 1
â€œOh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,â€ said the stranger with: 1
â€œOh, in the _Globe_, _Star_, _Pall Mall_, _St. Jamesâ€™s Gazette_,: 1
â€œOh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the: 1
â€œOh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must: 1
â€œOh, indeed!â€ said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. â€œYou: 1
â€œOh, it is a matter of no importance; but I donâ€™t know why you should: 1
â€œOh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the: 1
â€œOh, it wonâ€™t doâ€”really it wonâ€™t,â€ said Holmes suavely. â€œThere is no: 1
â€œOh, my night could not be called monotonous,â€ said he, and laughed. He: 1
â€œOh, no, no! I want the doctorâ€™s advice and help, too. Itâ€™s about Isa.: 1
â€œOh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but,: 1
â€œOh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the: 1
â€œOh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in: 1
â€œOh, really! I had no idea. And which king?â€: 1
â€œOh, she has turned all the menâ€™s heads down in that part. She is the: 1
â€œOh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,â€ cried the: 1
â€œOh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since: 1
â€œOh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There: 1
â€œOh, the cause is excellent!â€: 1
â€œOh, then we have three days yet,â€ said Holmes with a yawn. â€œThat is: 1
â€œOh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I: 1
â€œOh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward: 1
â€œOh, we shall soon clear up all that,â€ said Bradstreet. â€œWell, I have: 1
â€œOh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and: 1
â€œOh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about: 1
â€œOh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. His: 1
â€œOh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister: 1
â€œOh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should: 1
â€œOh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we: 1
â€œOh, yes, easily.â€: 1
â€œOh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasnâ€™t best pleased, Mr. Holmes,: 1
â€œOh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.â€: 1
â€œOh, yes, with the deepest interest.â€: 1
â€œOh, yes, you can. This is my point.â€ He placed his finger in the: 1
â€œOh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.â€: 1
â€œOh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.â€: 1
â€œOh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the _Morning Post_ to: 1
â€œOh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your: 1
â€œOh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van.: 1
â€œOh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well: 1
â€œOn June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at: 1
â€œOn Monday.â€: 1
â€œOn entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill: 1
â€œOn the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to: 1
â€œOn the contrary, my dear sir,â€ cried the King; â€œnothing could be more: 1
â€œOn the contrary, this is the right side.â€: 1
â€œOn the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.â€: 1
â€œOn the contrary,â€ said Holmes quietly; â€œI have every reason to believe: 1
â€œOn the contrary,â€ said Holmes, â€œit is the brightest rift which I can: 1
â€œOn the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from: 1
â€œOn your arm?â€: 1
â€œOne day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay: 1
â€œOne dayâ€”it was in March, 1883â€”a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon: 1
â€œOne horse?â€ interjected Holmes.: 1
â€œOne moment,â€ Holmes interposed, â€œyour statement is, I foresee, one of: 1
â€œOne moment,â€ said Holmes, â€œare you sure about this whistle and: 1
â€œOne more question. How did your mother take the matter?â€: 1
â€œOne of his hands.â€: 1
â€œOne of the highest in England.â€: 1
â€œOne tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no: 1
â€œOne?â€: 1
â€œOnly as much as we can deduce.â€: 1
â€œOnly once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.â€: 1
â€œOnly one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a: 1
â€œOnly two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in: 1
â€œOr rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which: 1
â€œOur quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King: 1
â€œOwe!â€ He caught up a pen. â€œName the sum, and I will pay it.â€: 1
â€œPeculiarâ€”that is the very word,â€ said Holmes. â€œIt is not an English: 1
â€œPending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not: 1
â€œPerfectly so.â€: 1
â€œPerhaps I have.â€: 1
â€œPerhaps we may make them less so.â€: 1
â€œPerhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying: 1
â€œPerhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the: 1
â€œPlease be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow,â€: 1
â€œPooh, pooh! Forgery.â€: 1
â€œPray be precise as to details,â€ said he.: 1
â€œPray compose yourself, sir,â€ said Holmes, â€œand let me have a clear: 1
â€œPray continue your narrative.â€: 1
â€œPray continue your very interesting statement.â€: 1
â€œPray continue,â€ said Holmes. â€œYour narrative promises to be a most: 1
â€œPray do so. I shall be all anxiety.â€: 1
â€œPray do so.â€: 1
â€œPray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.â€: 1
â€œPray let us have it, for all that.â€: 1
â€œPray make no apology to me,â€ said Lord St. Simon bitterly.: 1
â€œPray sit down on the sofa,â€ said Holmes gently. â€œYou had my note?â€: 1
â€œPray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I: 1
â€œPray take a seat,â€ said Holmes. â€œThis is my friend and colleague, Dr.: 1
â€œPray tell us what has happened to you.â€: 1
â€œPrecisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a: 1
â€œPrecisely so. But howâ€”â€: 1
â€œPrecisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into: 1
â€œPrecisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have: 1
â€œPrecisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His: 1
â€œPrecisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the: 1
â€œPrecisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and: 1
â€œPrecisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers,: 1
â€œPrecisely.â€: 2
â€œProceed, then.â€: 1
â€œPshaw! They did not know how to look.â€: 1
â€œPshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant: 1
â€œQuite an interesting study, that maiden,â€ he observed. â€œI found her: 1
â€œQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just: 1
â€œQuite so,â€ he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself: 1
â€œQuite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in: 1
â€œQuite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.â€: 1
â€œQuite so. Pray proceed with your statement.â€: 1
â€œQuite so. She has her freedom.â€: 1
â€œQuite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only: 1
â€œQuite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I: 1
â€œQuite so. There you are. And underneath?â€: 1
â€œQuite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary: 1
â€œQuite so.â€: 1
â€œQuite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made: 1
â€œQuite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however.: 1
â€œReally! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this: 1
â€œReally! You surprise me.â€: 1
â€œReally, Mr. Holmes,â€ said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from: 1
â€œReally, now!â€ cried the inspector, â€œyou have formed your opinion!: 1
â€œSarasate plays at the St. Jamesâ€™s Hall this afternoon,â€ he remarked.: 1
â€œSave, perhaps, the Sign of Four.â€: 1
â€œSee here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!â€ He held out his: 1
â€œSee that you keep yourself out of my grip,â€ he snarled, and hurling: 1
â€œSeeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,: 1
â€œSeven!â€ I answered.: 1
â€œShe brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?â€: 1
â€œShe died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to: 1
â€œShe is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is: 1
â€œShe showed me, as I told you she would.â€: 1
â€œShe told me to ask you.â€: 1
â€œShe walked into the breakfast-room.â€: 1
â€œShe was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter: 1
â€œShe was as bright as possibleâ€”at least until after the ceremony.â€: 1
â€œShe was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasnâ€™t, from the time that her: 1
â€œShe will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her: 1
â€œShe will not sell.â€: 1
â€œShould you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,â€ said our: 1
â€œShowing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the: 1
â€œSix out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse: 1
â€œSmall, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,: 1
â€œSmart fellow, that,â€ observed Holmes as we walked away. â€œHe is, in my: 1
â€œSo I am. But youâ€™ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few: 1
â€œSo I am. Very much so.â€: 1
â€œSo I have heard.â€: 1
â€œSo I heard. You have him here?â€: 1
â€œSo I see,â€ the other answered with the utmost coolness. â€œI fancy that: 1
â€œSo far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I: 1
â€œSo it appears.â€: 1
â€œSo much for Mr. Henry Baker,â€ said Holmes when he had closed the door: 1
â€œSo much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives: 1
â€œSo much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will: 1
â€œSo much so,â€ I remarked, â€œthat of the last six cases which I have: 1
â€œSo they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.â€: 1
â€œSold out of geese, I see,â€ continued Holmes, pointing at the bare: 1
â€œSome cold beef and a glass of beer,â€ he answered, ringing the bell. â€œI: 1
â€œSome ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.: 1
â€œSome years agoâ€”to be definite, in May, 1884â€”there came to Lee a: 1
â€œSometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,: 1
â€œStarving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since: 1
â€œStill, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course Iâ€™d have done my: 1
â€œStill, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is: 1
â€œStoke Moran?â€ said he.: 1
â€œStolen, then.â€: 1
â€œStolen.â€: 1
â€œStop it!â€ I cried; â€œpull yourself together!â€ and I poured out some: 1
â€œSubtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is: 1
â€œSuch as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning: 1
â€œSuddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter: 1
â€œSurely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a: 1
â€œSurely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.: 1
â€œTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.â€: 1
â€œTO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late: 1
â€œTell me,â€ broke in the engineer, â€œis Dr. Becher a German, very thin,: 1
â€œTen will be early enough.â€: 1
â€œTerrible! She is even more affected than I.â€: 1
â€œTerse and to the point,â€ remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin: 1
â€œTexas, I think.â€: 1
â€œThank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a: 1
â€œThank you for this information,â€ said he. â€œMay I see your father if I: 1
â€œThank you!â€ said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our: 1
â€œThank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.â€: 1
â€œThank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which: 1
â€œThank you,â€ said Holmes, â€œI only wished to ask you how you would go: 1
â€œThank you,â€ said my patient, â€œbut I have felt another man since the: 1
â€œThank you. And your address?â€: 1
â€œThank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most: 1
â€œThank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints,: 1
â€œThank you. I have not come to stay,â€ said I. â€œThere is a friend of: 1
â€œThank you. Pray proceed.â€: 1
â€œThank you. That is quite settled,â€ said he, rising and putting his: 1
â€œThank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck: 1
â€œThank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave: 1
â€œThat McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all: 1
â€œThat Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has: 1
â€œThat also I could fathom.â€: 1
â€œThat clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite: 1
â€œThat hurts my pride, Watson,â€ he said at last. â€œIt is a petty feeling,: 1
â€œThat is a detail which I shall speedily supply.â€: 1
â€œThat is a possible solutionâ€”in fact, as matters stand, it is the most: 1
â€œThat is also quite modern,â€ said the lady.: 1
â€œThat is better,â€ said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to: 1
â€œThat is easily got.â€: 1
â€œThat is enough.â€ She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all: 1
â€œThat is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare: 1
â€œThat is it on the dressing-table.â€: 1
â€œThat is not always so easy.â€: 1
â€œThat is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! itâ€™s a wicked world, and: 1
â€œThat is our signal,â€ said Holmes, springing to his feet; â€œit comes: 1
â€œThat is possible.â€: 1
â€œThat is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind: 1
â€œThat is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are: 1
â€œThat is unusual in a young girl.â€: 1
â€œThat is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?â€: 1
â€œThat is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St.: 1
â€œThat is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.â€: 1
â€œThat note only reached her yesterday,â€ said Holmes.: 1
â€œThat sounds a little paradoxical.â€: 1
â€œThat was it, sir.â€: 1
â€œThat was it,â€ said Holmes, nodding approvingly; â€œI have no doubt of: 1
â€œThat was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my: 1
â€œThat which my son himself indicatedâ€”that of the cupboard of the: 1
â€œThat will await him when he enters port,â€ said he, chuckling. â€œIt may: 1
â€œThat will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my: 1
â€œThat will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon: 1
â€œThat will do,â€ said Holmes. â€œAs to the letters,â€ he continued,: 1
â€œThat would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And: 1
â€œThat you are never beaten.â€: 1
â€œThatâ€™s better!â€ said he. â€œAnd now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly: 1
â€œThatâ€™s it!â€ cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. â€œThere is the: 1
â€œThatâ€™s no good.â€: 1
â€œThatâ€™s the list of the folk from whom I buy. Dâ€™you see? Well, then,: 1
â€œThatâ€™s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I donâ€™t know.â€: 1
â€œThe Cedars?â€: 1
â€œThe Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?: 1
â€œThe Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you,: 1
â€œThe Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.: 1
â€œThe Coroner: I understand that the cry of â€˜Cooeeâ€™ was a common signal: 1
â€œThe Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to: 1
â€œThe Coroner: What did you understand by that?: 1
â€œThe Coroner: What do you mean?: 1
â€œThe Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had: 1
â€œThe King of Scandinavia.â€: 1
â€œThe London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been: 1
â€œThe _Lone Star_ had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert: 1
â€œThe band! the speckled band!â€ whispered Holmes.: 1
â€œThe best possible.â€: 1
â€œThe case has been an interesting one,â€ remarked Holmes when our: 1
â€œThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to: 1
â€œThe decline of his fortunes, then?â€: 1
â€œThe doctor?â€: 1
â€œThe doctors examined her for it, but without success.â€: 1
â€œThe dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of: 1
â€œThe end may have been so,â€ I answered, â€œbut the methods I hold to have: 1
â€œThe facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy: 1
â€œThe family was at one time among the richest in England, and the: 1
â€œThe first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he: 1
â€œThe first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third: 1
â€œThe fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist: 1
â€œThe further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled,: 1
â€œThe gameâ€™s up, Ryder,â€ said Holmes quietly. â€œHold up, man, or youâ€™ll: 1
â€œThe gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed: 1
â€œThe gentleman I describe.â€: 1
â€œThe glass still keeps very high,â€ he remarked as he sat down. â€œIt is: 1
â€œThe goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!â€ he gasped.: 1
â€œThe grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days.: 1
â€œThe impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his: 1
â€œThe instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my: 1
â€œThe knees of his trousers.â€: 1
â€œThe lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same: 1
â€œThe landlord of the Alpha.â€: 1
â€œThe law cannot, as you say, touch you,â€ said Holmes, unlocking and: 1
â€œThe leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.â€: 1
â€œThe least sound would be fatal to our plans.â€: 1
â€œThe letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later,: 1
â€œThe man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,â€: 1
â€œThe man who wrote it was presumably well to do,â€ I remarked,: 1
â€œThe manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a: 1
â€œThe matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend: 1
â€œThe name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.â€: 1
â€œThe name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.: 1
â€œThe newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a: 1
â€œThe next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went: 1
â€œThe paper was made in Bohemia,â€ I said.: 1
â€œThe papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to: 1
â€œThe police have watched this Lascar,â€ said Inspector Bradstreet, â€œand: 1
â€œThe rest you will leave in our hands.â€: 1
â€œThe right side? Youâ€™re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over: 1
â€œThe stable lane?â€ She raised her dark eyebrows. â€œWhat can he hope to: 1
â€œThe third on the right is his,â€ said the inspector. â€œHere it is!â€ He: 1
â€œThe two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the: 1
â€œThe vanishing of the lady.â€: 1
â€œThe warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look: 1
â€œThe windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal: 1
â€œThe young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your: 1
â€œTheir reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it: 1
â€œThen I am your man.â€: 1
â€œThen I can wait in the next room.â€: 1
â€œThen I do not see the point.â€: 1
â€œThen I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should: 1
â€œThen I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the: 1
â€œThen I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to: 1
â€œThen I shall certainly come.â€: 1
â€œThen I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.â€: 1
â€œThen I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe,: 1
â€œThen I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still: 1
â€œThen I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up: 1
â€œThen I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,â€ said: 1
â€œThen I will.â€ Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without: 1
â€œThen Iâ€™ll tell our story right away,â€ said the lady. â€œFrank here and I: 1
â€œThen comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I: 1
â€œThen dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy: 1
â€œThen he might have called to you?â€: 1
â€œThen how many are there?â€: 1
â€œThen it was not Arthur who took them?â€: 1
â€œThen let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but: 1
â€œThen my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an: 1
â€œThen perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in: 1
â€œThen perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is: 1
â€œThen pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he: 1
â€œThen put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and: 1
â€œThen that will simplify matters.â€ We descended and started off once: 1
â€œThen the page we have seenâ€”â€: 1
â€œThen they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could: 1
â€œThen we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for: 1
â€œThen we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and: 1
â€œThen we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?â€: 1
â€œThen what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this: 1
â€œThen what has happened to him?â€: 1
â€œThen you donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll see him again?â€: 1
â€œThen you may be so with me.â€: 1
â€œThen you may entirely rely on me.â€: 1
â€œThen you wonâ€™t forgive me? You wonâ€™t shake hands before I go?â€: 1
â€œThen, as to money?â€: 1
â€œThen, come. I am all impatience to be gone.â€: 1
â€œThen, for Godâ€™s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in: 1
â€œThen, for pityâ€™s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sisterâ€™s: 1
â€œThen, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have: 1
â€œThen, how do you know?â€: 1
â€œThen, pray consult,â€ said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.: 1
â€œThen, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?â€: 1
â€œThen, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points: 1
â€œThen, what clue could you have as to his identity?â€: 1
â€œThen, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the: 1
â€œTheories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed: 1
â€œThere are none.â€: 1
â€œThere are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,â€ he: 1
â€œThere are three men waiting for him at the door,â€ said Holmes.: 1
â€œThere can be no question as to their nature,â€ he answered.: 1
â€œThere has been some villainy here,â€ said Holmes; â€œthis beauty has: 1
â€œThere is a train at half-past nine,â€ said I, glancing over my: 1
â€œThere is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called: 1
â€œThere is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or: 1
â€œThere is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put: 1
â€œThere is no mystery, my dear madam,â€ said he, smiling. â€œThe left arm: 1
â€œThere is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,â€ he answered,: 1
â€œThere is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,â€ said Sherlock Holmes: 1
â€œThere is one thing,â€ said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat: 1
â€œThere is serious news this morning,â€ Lestrade observed. â€œIt is said: 1
â€œThere is some building going on there,â€ said Holmes; â€œthat is where we: 1
â€œThere is the writing.â€: 1
â€œThere is your hat, then, and there your bird,â€ said he. â€œBy the way,: 1
â€œThere isnâ€™t a cat in it, for example?â€: 1
â€œThere was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double: 1
â€œThere was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,: 1
â€œThere was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of: 1
â€œThere was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a: 1
â€œThere were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my: 1
â€œThere will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight oâ€™clock,â€ it: 1
â€œThere you are,â€ said he. â€œThat circle is drawn at a radius of ten: 1
â€œThere, now!â€ she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly: 1
â€œThereâ€™s a cold-blooded scoundrel!â€ said Holmes, laughing, as he threw: 1
â€œThereâ€™s nothing in it. I looked at it before,â€ said Lestrade. â€œâ€˜Oct.: 1
â€œThereâ€™s the village,â€ said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs: 1
â€œThese are very deep waters,â€ said he; â€œpray go on with your: 1
â€œThey always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson,: 1
â€œThey are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.â€: 1
â€œThey are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the: 1
â€œThey are typewritten,â€ I remarked.: 1
â€œThey considered that it might be caused by Arthurâ€™s closing his: 1
â€œThey have but one retreat,â€ whispered Holmes. â€œThat is back through: 1
â€œThey have laid the supper, then,â€ he said, rubbing his hands.: 1
â€œThey have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the: 1
â€œThey must be cunning devils,â€ he exclaimed at last. â€œHow could they: 1
â€œThey must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been: 1
â€œThey often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the: 1
â€œThey seem to have been of a most interesting characterâ€”dummy: 1
â€œThird right, fourth left,â€ answered the assistant promptly, closing: 1
â€œThis Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.: 1
â€œThis aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the: 1
â€œThis concluded the examination of the witness.â€: 1
â€œThis discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed,: 1
â€œThis gentleman was not one of your wifeâ€™s friends?â€: 1
â€œThis gentleman?â€ she asked, facing round to me.: 1
â€œThis has been done,â€ said I, examining the wound, â€œby a very heavy and: 1
â€œThis hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear: 1
â€œThis hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came: 1
â€œThis is a very deep business,â€ he said at last. â€œThere are a thousand: 1
â€œThis is a very unexpected turn of affairs,â€ said I; â€œand what then?â€: 1
â€œThis is indeed a mystery,â€ I remarked. â€œWhat do you imagine that it: 1
â€œThis is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in: 1
â€œThis is the envelope,â€ he continued. â€œThe postmark is Londonâ€”eastern: 1
â€œThis is the girlâ€™s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,â€ said Holmes. â€œHe: 1
â€œThis matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her: 1
â€œThis may interest you, Lestrade,â€ he remarked, holding it out. â€œThe: 1
â€œThis photograph!â€: 1
â€œThis time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my: 1
â€œThis was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether: 1
â€œThis went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager: 1
â€œThis, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the: 1
â€œThreatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that: 1
â€œThrough the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.â€ He swung: 1
â€œTired-looking or fresh?â€: 1
â€œTo Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of: 1
â€œTo an English lawyer named Norton.â€: 1
â€œTo an end?â€: 1
â€œTo do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small: 1
â€œTo eat it!â€ Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.: 1
â€œTo ruin me.â€: 1
â€œTo smoke,â€ he answered. â€œIt is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg: 1
â€œTo tell the truthâ€â€”he sank his face into his thin, white handsâ€”â€œI have: 1
â€œTo the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He: 1
â€œTo the man who loves art for its own sake,â€ remarked Sherlock Holmes,: 1
â€œTo the police?â€: 1
â€œTry the settee,â€ said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting: 1
â€œTut! tut!â€ cried Sherlock Holmes. â€œYou must act, man, or you are lost.: 1
â€œTwo days later this same performance was gone through under exactly: 1
â€œTwo years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately: 1
â€œUndoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and: 1
â€œUnless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The: 1
â€œUpon what point?â€: 1
â€œVery glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe.: 1
â€œVery good, Lestrade,â€ said Holmes, laughing. â€œYou really are very fine: 1
â€œVery good. Come this way, if you please.â€ He led us down a passage,: 1
â€œVery good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.: 1
â€œVery good. Now, Mr. Wilson?â€: 1
â€œVery good. Your windows would be visible from there?â€: 1
â€œVery likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very: 1
â€œVery likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note,: 1
â€œVery much so.â€: 1
â€œVery murderous indeed.â€: 1
â€œVery naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the: 1
â€œVery naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat: 1
â€œVery sorry to knock you up, Watson,â€ said he, â€œbut itâ€™s the common lot: 1
â€œVery strange!â€ muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. â€œThere are one or: 1
â€œVery well, sir. And this stone?â€: 1
â€œVery well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so: 1
â€œVery well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only: 1
â€œVery, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?â€: 1
â€œVery. But will he see it?â€: 1
â€œWait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl,: 1
â€œWarm! Youâ€™d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I: 1
â€œWas he the only applicant?â€: 1
â€œWas she in good spirits?â€: 1
â€œWas the window open?â€: 1
â€œWas there a secret marriage?â€: 1
â€œWas your sister dressed?â€: 1
â€œWe are close there now,â€ my friend remarked. â€œThis fellow Merryweather: 1
â€œWe are on the outskirts of Lee,â€ said my companion. â€œWe have touched: 1
â€œWe could see the other side of the road and the Park.â€: 1
â€œWe do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no: 1
â€œWe have at least an hour before us,â€ he remarked, â€œfor they can hardly: 1
â€œWe have got to the deductions and the inferences,â€ said Lestrade,: 1
â€œWe have had the pleasure of making the Doctorâ€™s acquaintance,â€ said: 1
â€œWe have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,â€ said the: 1
â€œWe have retained these things for some days,â€ said Holmes, â€œbecause we: 1
â€œWe have tried and failed.â€: 1
â€œWe must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We: 1
â€œWe must have a cab.â€: 1
â€œWe must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.â€: 1
â€œWe shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven oâ€™clock, my friend and I.: 1
â€œWe shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one: 1
â€œWe shall see.â€ He pushed past the servant and rushed into the: 1
â€œWe shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the: 1
â€œWe went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat: 1
â€œWe were both in the photograph.â€: 1
â€œWedlock suits you,â€ he remarked. â€œI think, Watson, that you have put: 1
â€œWell then, I shanâ€™t tell you. So now!â€: 1
â€œWell, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the: 1
â€œWell, I donâ€™t know why not,â€ said the inspector. â€œHe doesnâ€™t look a: 1
â€œWell, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the: 1
â€œWell, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.â€: 1
â€œWell, I have no connection with any other people who have been making: 1
â€œWell, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.â€: 1
â€œWell, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low: 1
â€œWell, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the: 1
â€œWell, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was: 1
â€œWell, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little: 1
â€œWell, Watson,â€ said Holmes when our visitor had left us, â€œwhat do you: 1
â€œWell, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned: 1
â€œWell, at least,â€ said Holmes, â€œyou have had your revenge upon them.: 1
â€œWell, but China?â€: 1
â€œWell, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,â€ said Holmes,: 1
â€œWell, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them: 1
â€œWell, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote: 1
â€œWell, have you solved it?â€ I asked as I entered.: 1
â€œWell, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man,: 1
â€œWell, it is a possible supposition.â€: 1
â€œWell, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted: 1
â€œWell, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,â€: 1
â€œWell, it is not for me to judge you,â€ said Holmes as the old man: 1
â€œWell, it is very ingenious,â€ said I, laughing; â€œbut since, as you said: 1
â€œWell, it was the beginning of â€™84 when my father came to live at: 1
â€œWell, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for: 1
â€œWell, look at this!â€ He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on: 1
â€œWell, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,â€ said Holmes, laughing.: 1
â€œWell, now, in considering this case there are two points about young: 1
â€œWell, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as: 1
â€œWell, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer: 1
â€œWell, really!â€ he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he: 1
â€œWell, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have: 1
â€œWell, really, when I consider that she has turned her backâ€”I will not: 1
â€œWell, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a: 1
â€œWell, some hundreds of times.â€: 1
â€œWell, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and: 1
â€œWell, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?â€: 1
â€œWell, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.â€: 1
â€œWell, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had: 1
â€œWell, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet: 1
â€œWell, then, youâ€™ve lost your fiver, for itâ€™s town bred,â€ snapped the: 1
â€œWell, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.â€: 1
â€œWell, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator: 1
â€œWell, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle: 1
â€œWell, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse: 1
â€œWell, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.: 1
â€œWell, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever: 1
â€œWell, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money.: 1
â€œWell, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.: 1
â€œWell, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as: 1
â€œWell, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much: 1
â€œWell, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they: 1
â€œWell, yes, of course the pay is goodâ€”too good. That is what makes me: 1
â€œWell, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me: 1
â€œWell, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. Iâ€™ve had enough: 1
â€œWell, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the: 1
â€œWell, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work: 1
â€œWell, you know father didnâ€™t like anything of the sort. He wouldnâ€™t: 1
â€œWell, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I: 1
â€œWell,â€ said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once: 1
â€œWell.â€: 1
â€œWell?â€: 1
â€œWell?â€ she cried, â€œwell?â€ And then, seeing that there were two of us,: 1
â€œWere there gipsies in the plantation at the time?â€: 1
â€œWere they all fastened this morning?â€: 1
â€œWere you engaged to the gentleman at this time?â€: 1
â€œWeâ€™ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a: 1
â€œWeâ€™re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,â€ said Jones in his: 1
â€œWhat I cannot understand,â€ said I, â€œis why they should have spared you: 1
â€œWhat I expected to see.â€: 1
â€œWhat _can_ be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?â€: 1
â€œWhat a womanâ€”oh, what a woman!â€ cried the King of Bohemia, when we had: 1
â€œWhat are they?â€: 1
â€œWhat are you going to do, then?â€ I asked.: 1
â€œWhat becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very: 1
â€œWhat can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?â€: 1
â€œWhat can it mean?â€ I gasped.: 1
â€œWhat can you not understand?â€: 1
â€œWhat could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points: 1
â€œWhat did you go into the pool for?â€ he asked.: 1
â€œWhat do you make of that, Watson?â€: 1
â€œWhat do you make of that?â€ asked Holmes.: 1
â€œWhat do you mean?â€: 1
â€œWhat do you say, dear?â€ said my wife, looking across at me. â€œWill you: 1
â€œWhat do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?â€: 1
â€œWhat do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few: 1
â€œWhat else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five: 1
â€œWhat has she been saying to you?â€ screamed the old man furiously.: 1
â€œWhat have you done?â€ asked Holmes.: 1
â€œWhat have you to say now?â€: 1
â€œWhat is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?â€: 1
â€œWhat is it, then?â€ I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some: 1
â€œWhat is it, thenâ€”a fire?â€: 1
â€œWhat is it?â€: 1
â€œWhat is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?â€: 1
â€œWhat is the name of this obliging youth?â€ asked Sherlock Holmes.: 1
â€œWhat is the young manâ€™s own account of the matter?â€: 1
â€œWhat of the rat, then?â€: 1
â€œWhat of this â€˜Cooee!â€™ then?â€: 1
â€œWhat office?â€: 1
â€œWhat on earth can be the matter with him?â€ I asked. â€œHe is looking up: 1
â€œWhat on earth does this mean?â€ I ejaculated after I had twice read: 1
â€œWhat on earth has that to do with it?â€ I ejaculated.: 1
â€œWhat shall I do?â€: 1
â€œWhat steps will you take?â€ I asked.: 1
â€œWhat then?â€: 3
â€œWhat will the Duke say,â€ he murmured, â€œwhen he hears that one of the: 1
â€œWhat will you do, then?â€: 1
â€œWhat will you say?â€: 1
â€œWhat! Had he lost his wife?â€: 1
â€œWhat! You do not mean bodies?â€: 1
â€œWhat! a murderous attack?â€: 1
â€œWhat! where?â€ shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and: 1
â€œWhat!â€ Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and: 1
â€œWhat!â€ he roared.: 1
â€œWhat, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!â€: 1
â€œWhat, then, did Peterson do?â€: 1
â€œWhat, then?â€: 1
â€œWhat?â€: 1
â€œWhatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,â€ said she. â€œI: 1
â€œWhatâ€™s in here?â€ he asked, tapping the safe.: 1
â€œWhatâ€™s up, then?â€ asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. â€œYou look: 1
â€œWhen Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the: 1
â€œWhen I arrived at the house,â€ continued Holmes, â€œI at once went very: 1
â€œWhen I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and: 1
â€œWhen I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a: 1
â€œWhen Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.: 1
â€œWhen did it break out?â€: 1
â€œWhen did she vanish, then?â€: 1
â€œWhen did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?â€: 1
â€œWhen evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so: 1
â€œWhen he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was: 1
â€œWhen my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made: 1
â€œWhen we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after: 1
â€œWhen you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a: 1
â€œWhen you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the â€˜Pink â€™unâ€™: 1
â€œWhere did he live, then?â€: 1
â€œWhere did you address your letters, then?â€: 1
â€œWhere does that bell communicate with?â€ he asked at last pointing to a: 1
â€œWhere is it, then?â€: 1
â€œWhere to?â€: 1
â€œWhere, indeed?â€: 1
â€œWhere, then, is my wife?â€: 1
â€œWhere, then?â€: 1
â€œWhich are?â€: 1
â€œWhich key was used to open it?â€ he asked.: 1
â€œWhich of you is Holmes?â€ asked this apparition.: 1
â€œWhich surely he restored to their owner?â€: 1
â€œWhich were very well justified,â€ observed Holmes. â€œAnd now it is time: 1
â€œWho are you, then? What do you want?â€ he asked in a quavering voice.: 1
â€œWho by?â€: 1
â€œWho ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip: 1
â€œWho is on duty?â€ asked Holmes.: 1
â€œWho knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect: 1
â€œWho was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss: 1
â€œWho was the criminal, then?â€: 1
â€œWhose house is it?â€: 1
â€œWhy did you beat the pavement?â€: 1
â€œWhy did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?â€ asked Sherlock: 1
â€œWhy did you come to me?â€ he said, â€œand, above all, why did you not: 1
â€œWhy did you pick him?â€: 1
â€œWhy is he silent, then, if he is innocent?â€: 1
â€œWhy serious?â€: 1
â€œWhy, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an _employÃ©_ who comes: 1
â€œWhy, indeed?â€ murmured Holmes. â€œYour Majesty had not spoken before I: 1
â€œWhy, it is after nine now,â€ I answered. â€œI should not be surprised if: 1
â€œWhy, itâ€™s a dummy,â€ said he.: 1
â€œWhy, what do you mean?â€: 1
â€œWhy,â€ said I, glancing up at my companion, â€œthat was surely the bell.: 1
â€œWhy,â€ said my wife, pulling up her veil, â€œit is Kate Whitney. How you: 1
â€œWhy? What do you mean?â€: 1
â€œWill you bet, then?â€: 1
â€œWill you come with me?â€ asked Holmes, glancing up.: 1
â€œWith making away with Mr. Neville St.â€” Oh, come, you canâ€™t be charged: 1
â€œWith the result of driving it through the ventilator.â€: 1
â€œWithout, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me: 1
â€œWitness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.: 1
â€œWitness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion: 1
â€œWitness: I must still refuse.: 1
â€œWitness: I should prefer not to answer.: 1
â€œWitness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open,: 1
â€œWitness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was: 1
â€œWitness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you: 1
â€œWitness: It was.: 1
â€œWitness: Nothing definite.: 1
â€œWonâ€™t it ring?â€: 1
â€œWould you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your: 1
â€œYes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,â€ said he. â€œI am: 1
â€œYes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.â€: 1
â€œYes, I have got it now,â€ he answered with his thick red finger planted: 1
â€œYes, I have one waiting.â€: 1
â€œYes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the: 1
â€œYes, all.â€: 1
â€œYes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have: 1
â€œYes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.â€: 1
â€œYes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I donâ€™t wonder that you: 1
â€œYes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may: 1
â€œYes, at the mines.â€: 1
â€œYes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a: 1
â€œYes, but only for you and me.â€: 1
â€œYes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.â€: 1
â€œYes, certainly.â€: 1
â€œYes, from Horsham.â€: 1
â€œYes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years: 1
â€œYes, he did.â€: 1
â€œYes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met: 1
â€œYes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have: 1
â€œYes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is: 1
â€œYes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village: 1
â€œYes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.â€: 1
â€œYes, it was twisted.â€: 1
â€œYes, it would be as well.â€: 1
â€œYes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I: 1
â€œYes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up: 1
â€œYes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,â€ he: 1
â€œYes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too,: 1
â€œYes, only one.â€: 1
â€œYes, sir!â€ said the station-master.: 1
â€œYes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.â€: 1
â€œYes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviourâ€™s, near Kingâ€™s: 1
â€œYes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,â€ remarked the: 1
â€œYes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.â€: 1
â€œYes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual: 1
â€œYes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking: 1
â€œYes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a: 1
â€œYes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my: 1
â€œYes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not: 1
â€œYes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we: 1
â€œYes, sir.â€: 2
â€œYes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.â€: 1
â€œYes, that is it.â€ It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building,: 1
â€œYes, that is the Crown.â€: 1
â€œYes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see: 1
â€œYes, the wine-cellar.â€: 1
â€œYes, there are nearly always some there.â€: 1
â€œYes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.â€: 1
â€œYes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.â€: 1
â€œYes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has: 1
â€œYes, they were peculiar boots.â€: 1
â€œYes, to-day.â€ She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in: 1
â€œYes,â€ I answered, laughing. â€œIt was a singular document. Philosophy,: 1
â€œYes,â€ said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. â€œIt is: 1
â€œYes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.â€: 1
â€œYes. He waved his hands.â€: 1
â€œYes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty,: 1
â€œYes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing: 1
â€œYes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was: 1
â€œYes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.â€: 1
â€œYes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so: 1
â€œYes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and: 1
â€œYes.â€: 12
â€œYes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think: 1
â€œYes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.â€: 1
â€œYes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and: 1
â€œYes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.â€: 1
â€œYes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey.: 1
â€œYes; that is Mr. St. Clairâ€™s house. I am staying there while I conduct: 1
â€œYes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met: 1
â€œYes?â€: 1
â€œYesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card: 1
â€œYesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my: 1
â€œYesterday.â€: 1
â€œYet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are: 1
â€œYou appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to: 1
â€œYou are all wrong.â€: 1
â€œYou are certainly joking, Holmes.â€: 1
â€œYou are engaged,â€ said I; â€œperhaps I interrupt you.â€: 1
â€œYou are hungry,â€ I remarked.: 1
â€œYou are not very vulnerable from above,â€ Holmes remarked as he held up: 1
â€œYou are right,â€ said Holmes demurely; â€œyou do find it very hard to: 1
â€œYou are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know: 1
â€œYou are sure that she has not sent it yet?â€: 1
â€œYou are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a: 1
â€œYou are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.â€: 1
â€œYou are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true: 1
â€œYou can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she: 1
â€œYou can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what: 1
â€œYou can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no: 1
â€œYou can understand,â€ said Holmes suavely, â€œthat I extend to the: 1
â€œYou could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,â€ he: 1
â€œYou did it very nicely, Doctor,â€ he remarked. â€œNothing could have been: 1
â€œYou did not overhear what they said?â€: 1
â€œYou did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for: 1
â€œYou didnâ€™t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I: 1
â€œYou donâ€™t mind breaking the law?â€: 1
â€œYou fill me with interest,â€ said Holmes. â€œPray give us the essential: 1
â€œYou forget that I know nothing about it.â€: 1
â€œYou had my note?â€ he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly: 1
â€œYou have _carte blanche_.â€: 1
â€œYou have a clue?â€: 1
â€œYou have a grand gift of silence, Watson,â€ said he. â€œIt makes you: 1
â€œYou have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to: 1
â€œYou have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that: 1
â€œYou have been cruelly used,â€ said Holmes.: 1
â€œYou have but to name it.â€: 1
â€œYou have come to me to tell your story, have you not?â€ said he. â€œYou: 1
â€œYou have compromised yourself seriously.â€: 1
â€œYou have done well indeed!â€ cried Holmes with enthusiasm. â€œNow lead: 1
â€œYou have done wisely,â€ said my friend. â€œBut have you told me all?â€: 1
â€œYou have erred, perhaps,â€ he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with: 1
â€œYou have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you: 1
â€œYou have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,: 1
â€œYou have it!â€ he gasped. â€œI am saved! I am saved!â€: 1
â€œYou have it, sir, just as it happened.â€: 1
â€œYou have made your position very clear to me,â€ said Holmes. â€œThis is: 1
â€œYou have neither of you any doubt as to your sonâ€™s guilt?â€: 1
â€œYou have really got it!â€ he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either: 1
â€œYou have the photograph?â€: 1
â€œYou heard nothing yourself last night?â€: 1
â€œYou horrify me!â€: 1
â€œYou horrify me.â€: 1
â€œYou interest me extremely,â€ said Holmes. â€œAnd since you draw so large: 1
â€œYou know me, then?â€: 1
â€œYou know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.â€: 1
â€œYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I: 1
â€œYou may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an: 1
â€œYou may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,â€ said the: 1
â€œYou must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,: 1
â€œYou must know that my grandfather had two sonsâ€”my uncle Elias and my: 1
â€œYou must know,â€ said he, â€œthat I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing: 1
â€œYou must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.: 1
â€œYou must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented: 1
â€œYou must not fear,â€ said he soothingly, bending forward and patting: 1
â€œYou reasoned it out beautifully,â€ I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration.: 1
â€œYou saw the ventilator, too?â€: 1
â€œYou see it, Watson?â€ he yelled. â€œYou see it?â€: 1
â€œYou see, Watson,â€ he explained in the early hours of the morning as we: 1
â€œYou see,â€ remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the: 1
â€œYou seem to expect company. They have laid for five.â€: 1
â€œYou seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave: 1
â€œYou shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all: 1
â€œYou speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than: 1
â€œYou then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he: 1
â€œYou think so, too?â€: 1
â€œYou think that he is dead?â€: 1
â€œYou villain!â€ said he, â€œwhereâ€™s your daughter?â€: 1
â€œYou want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,â€ he remarked as we emerged.: 1
â€œYou were not yourself at fault at all, then?â€: 1
â€œYou were travelling in the States?â€: 1
â€œYou were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by: 1
â€œYou will excuse me for not waiting for you,â€ said he; â€œI have, I: 1
â€œYou will excuse me,â€ said Holmes blandly, â€œbut I could not help: 1
â€œYou will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,â€ said he, â€œbut you: 1
â€œYou will excuse my calling so late,â€ she began, and then, suddenly: 1
â€œYou will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,â€ said she, as my: 1
â€œYou will excuse this mask,â€ continued our strange visitor. â€œThe august: 1
â€œYou will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to: 1
â€œYou will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate: 1
â€œYou will not go there first?â€: 1
â€œYou will observe,â€ said Holmes, laying down the volume, â€œthat the: 1
â€œYou will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went: 1
â€œYou will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go: 1
â€œYou would have done better to have trusted your wife.â€: 1
â€œYou would not think Â£ 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?â€: 1
â€œYou? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?â€: 1
â€œYour French gold?â€: 1
â€œYour Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,â€: 1
â€œYour Majesty must pay. It must be bought.â€: 1
â€œYour beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,â€ said: 1
â€œYour boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he: 1
â€œYour cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,â€ I: 1
â€œYour experience has been a most entertaining one,â€ remarked Holmes as: 1
â€œYour father,â€ said Holmes, â€œyour stepfather, surely, since the name is: 1
â€œYour hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than: 1
â€œYour own little income,â€ he asked, â€œdoes it come out of the business?â€: 1
â€œYour presence might be invaluable.â€: 1
â€œYour reasoning is certainly plausible.â€: 1
â€œYour sister asked for it, I suppose?â€: 1
â€œYour sister is dead, then?â€: 1
â€œYour son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?â€: 1
â€œYouâ€™ll never persuade me to believe that.â€: 1
â€œYouâ€™ll see your pal again presently,â€ said Jones. â€œHeâ€™s quicker at: 1
â€œYouâ€™re angry, Robert,â€ said she. â€œWell, I guess you have every cause: 1
â€œ_Nous verrons_,â€ answered Holmes calmly. â€œYou work your own method,: 1
â€œby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of: 1
â€œheâ€™s all right.â€: 1
â€œof course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you: 1
â€œthe thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I: 1
â€œthis is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?â€: 1
â€œwhat are you driving at? Letâ€™s have it straight, now.â€: 1
â€œâ€˜A dozen yards or so.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜About the same.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference: 1
â€œâ€˜Ah!â€™ said he carelessly, â€˜we have our own process. We compress the: 1
â€œâ€˜Ah!â€™ said he, â€˜you must not think me rude if I passed you without a: 1
â€œâ€˜Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity,: 1
â€œâ€˜Ample.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜And a very good thing, too!â€™ I cried.: 1
â€œâ€˜And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜And he is admirably suited for it,â€™ the other answered. â€˜He has every: 1
â€œâ€˜And how far from the edge of the wood?â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜And not a word to a soul.â€™ He looked at me with a last long,: 1
â€œâ€˜And the work?â€™: 2
â€œâ€˜And what are they worth?â€™ I asked.: 1
â€œâ€˜And what salary do you ask?â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Arthur!â€™ I screamed, â€˜you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that: 1
â€œâ€˜As governess?â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜At least,â€™ said he, â€˜you will not have me arrested at once. It would: 1
â€œâ€˜Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the: 1
â€œâ€˜Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H: 1
â€œâ€˜Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜But was there another with a barred tail?â€™ I asked, â€˜the same as the: 1
â€œâ€˜But, madam,â€™ said I, â€˜I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot: 1
â€œâ€˜But,â€™ said I, â€˜there would be millions of red-headed men who would: 1
â€œâ€˜Certainly not. But why?â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Certainly not.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Certainly,â€™ I answered.: 1
â€œâ€˜Come! come!â€™ she cried breathlessly. â€˜They will be here in a moment.: 1
â€œâ€˜Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it wonâ€™t be legal.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to: 1
â€œâ€˜Dear me!â€™ he said gravely, â€˜that is very serious indeed! I am sorry: 1
â€œâ€˜Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge: 1
â€œâ€˜Death,â€™ said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room,: 1
â€œâ€˜December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7_s_. 6_d_.â€™â€: 1
â€œâ€˜Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?â€™ she asked.: 1
â€œâ€˜Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Do you promise, then?â€™ said he at last.: 1
â€œâ€˜Donâ€™t be frightened,â€™ said my employer, laughing at the start which I: 1
â€œâ€˜Entirely.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?â€™ I asked.: 1
â€œâ€˜Fritz! Fritz!â€™ she cried in English, â€˜remember your promise after the: 1
â€œâ€˜From Dundee,â€™ I answered, glancing at the postmark.: 1
â€œâ€˜Gone to the dealerâ€™s, Jem.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on: 1
â€œâ€˜Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?â€™ he asked: 1
â€œâ€˜Here we are, Jack,â€™ says he, touching me on the arm; â€˜weâ€™ll be as: 1
â€œâ€˜How far from the body?â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜How would fifty guineas for a nightâ€™s work suit you?â€™ he asked.: 1
â€œâ€˜I am afraid that it is quite essential,â€™ said he. â€˜It is a little: 1
â€œâ€˜I am afraid that that is quite impossible,â€™ said I. He had been: 1
â€œâ€˜I am sure if I had knownâ€”â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜I am sure that I do not know.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜I beg that you will state your business, sir,â€™ said I; â€˜my time is of: 1
â€œâ€˜I had better put my hat on, I suppose.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜I had Â£ 4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜I have already given you my word.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜I have heard so.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜I quite follow you,â€™ said I. â€˜The only point which I could not quite: 1
â€œâ€˜I say a nightâ€™s work, but an hourâ€™s would be nearer the mark. I: 1
â€œâ€˜I shall certainly be there.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own: 1
â€œâ€˜I should be happy to make myself useful.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜I should certainly speak to the police,â€™ I said.: 1
â€œâ€˜I should much prefer to have it so,â€™ said he, raising up a square,: 1
â€œâ€˜I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your: 1
â€œâ€˜I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,â€™ I answered. â€˜But it: 1
â€œâ€˜I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜I wish you, John,â€™ said my uncle, â€˜to witness my will. I leave my: 1
â€œâ€˜I would go,â€™ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak: 1
â€œâ€˜If I promise to keep a secret,â€™ said I, â€˜you may absolutely depend: 1
â€œâ€˜If you please, Miss Stoper.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜In my own bureau.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜In the case of another,â€™ said he, â€˜the objection might be fatal, but: 1

â€œâ€˜It is absolutely essential to me,â€™ said he, â€˜that I should have Â£: 1
â€œâ€˜It is also my custom,â€™ said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion: 1
â€œâ€˜It is locked up,â€™ I answered.: 1
â€œâ€˜It is not worth your while to wait,â€™ she went on. â€˜You can pass: 1
â€œâ€˜It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?â€™ He: 1
â€œâ€˜It is your only chance,â€™ said she. â€˜It is high, but it may be that: 1
â€œâ€˜It would be injustice to hesitate,â€™ said he. â€˜You will, however, I am: 1
â€œâ€˜Itâ€™s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,â€™ said: 1
â€œâ€˜Jephro,â€™ said she, â€˜there is an impertinent fellow upon the road: 1
â€œâ€˜Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,â€™ he answered, turning: 1
â€œâ€˜Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the: 1
â€œâ€˜Look here, dad,â€™ said he with his eyes cast down, â€˜can you let me: 1
â€œâ€˜Look in here!â€™ said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two: 1
â€œâ€˜May I ask where you live, sir?â€™ said I.: 1
â€œâ€˜Most admirably.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Mr. Hatherley?â€™ said he, with something of a German accent. â€˜You have: 1
â€œâ€˜Mr. Holder,â€™ said he, â€˜I have been informed that you are in the habit: 1
â€œâ€˜My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,â€™ said I. â€˜A: 1
â€œâ€˜My dear young lady! my dear young lady!â€™â€”you cannot think how: 1
â€œâ€˜My name,â€™ said he, â€˜is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the: 1
â€œâ€˜My sole duties, then,â€™ I asked, â€˜are to take charge of a single: 1
â€œâ€˜Never mind. Iâ€™ll have the other, and Iâ€™ll take it now,â€™ said I.: 1
â€œâ€˜Never,â€™ said I.: 1
â€œâ€˜Never.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most: 1
â€œâ€˜No excuse will avail,â€™ said Mr. Duncan Ross; â€˜neither sickness nor: 1
â€œâ€˜No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?â€™ he asked.: 1
â€œâ€˜No, I cannot!â€™ I answered sharply. â€˜I have been far too generous with: 1
â€œâ€˜No, I forbid you. I wonâ€™t have a fuss made about such nonsense.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜No, I had a feeling something was there.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜No, I know no one in these parts.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,â€™ he cried.: 1
â€œâ€˜No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round: 1
â€œâ€˜No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All: 1
â€œâ€˜No, sir, I really could not,â€™ I answered firmly.: 1
â€œâ€˜No,â€™ said I, considerably astonished at his words.: 1
â€œâ€˜Not at all. I only doubtâ€”â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Not so many as you might think,â€™ he answered. â€˜You see it is really: 1
â€œâ€˜Oh, I am so frightened!â€™ I panted.: 1
â€œâ€˜Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have: 1
â€œâ€˜Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King: 1
â€œâ€˜Oh, just as you like,â€™ said she, a little huffed. â€˜Which is it you: 1
â€œâ€˜Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it: 1
â€œâ€˜Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!â€™ said Vincent Spaulding. â€˜I: 1
â€œâ€˜Oh, no, it is in the house.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Oh, no.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Oh, tut, tut! sweatingâ€”rank sweating!â€™ he cried, throwing his fat: 1
â€œâ€˜Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Oh, yes,â€™ said he, turning to me, â€˜we are very much obliged to you,: 1
â€œâ€˜Oh,â€™ said he, â€˜his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and: 1
â€œâ€˜Oh,â€™ says she, â€˜weâ€™ve set yours aside for youâ€”Jemâ€™s bird, we call it.: 1
â€œâ€˜On the contrary,â€™ said I, â€˜I opened the door myself because I felt: 1
â€œâ€˜One childâ€”one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could: 1
â€œâ€˜One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,â€™ said I.: 1
â€œâ€˜Only that?â€™ said he, looking at me keenly.: 1
â€œâ€˜Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few: 1
â€œâ€˜Photography is one of my hobbies,â€™ said he. â€˜I have made my dark room: 1
â€œâ€˜Pooh!â€™ said he, gripping hard at his courage. â€˜We are in a civilised: 1
â€œâ€˜Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Precisely.â€™ He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,: 1
â€œâ€˜Put the papers on the sundial,â€™ I read, peeping over his shoulder.: 1
â€œâ€˜Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you: 1
â€œâ€˜Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have: 1
â€œâ€˜Quite sure, dad.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has: 1
â€œâ€˜So,â€™ said he, smiling, â€˜it was you, then. I thought that it must be: 1
â€œâ€˜Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12_s_.â€™â€: 1
â€œâ€˜Some little time ago I bought a small placeâ€”a very small placeâ€”within: 1
â€œâ€˜Some preposterous practical joke,â€™ said he. â€˜What have I to do with: 1
â€œâ€˜Stolen!â€™ he cried.: 1
â€œâ€˜Surely it would be better to take no notice.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Tell me all about it,â€™ said I.: 1
â€œâ€˜Tell me, Helen,â€™ said she, â€˜have you ever heard anyone whistle in the: 1
â€œâ€˜Tell me, dad,â€™ said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, â€˜did: 1
â€œâ€˜Ten to two.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Thank God,â€™ he cried. â€˜Youâ€™ll do. Come! Come!â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Thank you, Maggie,â€™ says I; â€˜but if it is all the same to you, Iâ€™d: 1
â€œâ€˜That is quite correct,â€™ I answered; â€˜but you will excuse me if I say: 1
â€œâ€˜That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the: 1
â€œâ€˜That will do,â€™ said he; â€˜I could not ask for anything better.: 1
â€œâ€˜That would suit me very well,â€™ said I. â€˜And the pay?â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have: 1
â€œâ€˜Thatâ€™s all right,â€™ said he, coming back. â€˜I know that clerks are: 1
â€œâ€˜The Church of St. Monica, John,â€™ she cried, â€˜and half a sovereign if: 1
â€œâ€˜The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.: 1
â€œâ€˜The ceremony, which was performed at St. Georgeâ€™s, Hanover Square,: 1
â€œâ€˜The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest: 1
â€œâ€˜The firm does so when the security is good.â€™ I answered.: 1
â€œâ€˜The other is a good three pound heavier,â€™ said she, â€˜and we fattened: 1
â€œâ€˜The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about: 1
â€œâ€˜The sundial in the garden. There is no other,â€™ said I; â€˜but the: 1
â€œâ€˜The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of: 1
â€œâ€˜Then let me do so?â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that: 1
â€œâ€˜Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would: 1
â€œâ€˜Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once: 1
â€œâ€˜Then, good-night.â€™ I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again,: 1
â€œâ€˜There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,â€™ said he.: 1
â€œâ€˜There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you: 1
â€œâ€˜There is a drive, then?â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜They may do what they like, but Iâ€™ll checkmate them still,â€™ said he: 1
â€œâ€˜This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,â€™ said my assistant, â€˜and he is willing to: 1
â€œâ€˜This is my secretary and manager,â€™ said the colonel. â€˜By the way, I: 1
â€œâ€˜To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of: 1
â€œâ€˜Tut, tut!â€™ he cried. â€˜This is all quite beside the question. The: 1
â€œâ€˜Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the: 1
â€œâ€˜Very good.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Very good.â€™ He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across: 1
â€œâ€˜Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did: 1
â€œâ€˜Very well,â€™ said he, â€˜you shall know all about the machine.â€™ He took: 1
â€œâ€˜We are now,â€™ said he, â€˜actually within the hydraulic press, and it: 1
â€œâ€˜We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense: 1
â€œâ€˜Well, I hope to goodness the house wonâ€™t be burgled during the: 1
â€œâ€˜Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,â€™ said I.: 1
â€œâ€˜Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.â€™ She smiled back at: 1
â€œâ€˜Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at: 1
â€œâ€˜Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most: 1
â€œâ€˜Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that: 1
â€œâ€˜Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the: 1
â€œâ€˜Well,â€™ said I, â€˜the gentleman at No. 4.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Well,â€™ said I, â€˜you said youâ€™d give me one for Christmas, and I was: 1
â€œâ€˜Well,â€™ said he, showing me the advertisement, â€˜you can see for: 1
â€œâ€˜What are you doing there?â€™ he asked.: 1
â€œâ€˜What do you call purely nominal?â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜What is it, uncle?â€™ I cried.: 1
â€œâ€˜What papers? What sundial?â€™ he asked.: 1
â€œâ€˜What then?â€™ I asked.: 1
â€œâ€˜What would be the hours?â€™ I asked.: 1
â€œâ€˜What, the red-headed man?â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜What, you dig fullerâ€™s-earth in the house?â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?â€™ says she.: 1
â€œâ€˜Where are they all, Maggie?â€™ I cried.: 1
â€œâ€˜Where could I find him?â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Where have you put it?â€™ asked Arthur.: 1
â€œâ€˜Where to?â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Which dealerâ€™s?â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Why do you think that I lock this door?â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Why that?â€™ I asks.: 1
â€œâ€˜Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the: 1
â€œâ€˜Why, what did you think?â€™ I asked.: 1
â€œâ€˜Why, what is it, then?â€™ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very: 1
â€œâ€˜Why, what on earth does this mean, John?â€™ he stammered.: 1
â€œâ€˜Why,â€™ says he, â€˜hereâ€™s another vacancy on the League of the: 1
â€œâ€˜Yes, I promise.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell: 1
â€œâ€˜Yes, but with my back towards it.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,â€™ said he.: 1
â€œâ€˜Yes, it was gone.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven: 1
â€œâ€˜Yes, sir.â€™: 2
â€œâ€˜Yes, thief!â€™ I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.: 1
â€œâ€˜Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜Yes.â€™: 1
â€œâ€˜You are looking for a situation, miss?â€™ he asked.: 1
â€œâ€˜You are mad, Elise!â€™ he shouted, struggling to break away from her.: 1
â€œâ€˜You blackguard!â€™ I shouted, beside myself with rage. â€˜You have: 1
â€œâ€˜You doubt its value?â€™ he asked.: 1
â€œâ€˜You have been very kind,â€™ said he, â€˜but I must have this money, or: 1
â€œâ€˜You have called me names enough,â€™ said he, â€˜I will not stand it any: 1
â€œâ€˜You may as well face the matter,â€™ said I; â€˜you have been caught in: 1
â€œâ€˜You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are: 1
â€œâ€˜You shall learn nothing from me,â€™ said he with a passion such as I: 1
â€œâ€˜You shall leave it in the hands of the police!â€™ I cried half-mad with: 1
â€œâ€˜You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of: 1
â€œâ€™Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have: 1
â€˜A marriage has been arranged,â€™ it says, â€˜and will, if rumour is: 1
â€˜I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and: 1
â€˜Iâ€™ve let them go at six hundred for the three!â€™ I soon managed to get: 1
â€˜There is water in your eyes,â€™ said he as he released me. â€˜I perceive: 1
â€˜You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!â€™: 1
â€˜Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to: 1
